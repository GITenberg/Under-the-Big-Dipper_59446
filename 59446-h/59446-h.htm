<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">INDIA the wonderful&mdash;India the home of Buddha
and the land of mystery and misery. The country
of glorious traditions and unsatisfied desires!
What ambitions have not been dreamed, what visions
not conjured in your cause! Assyrian and Greek,
Mongol and Parsee, Portuguese rover, Dutch trader,
Russian diplomat and English merchant prince&mdash;all
have sought thee and thy wealth, all have fought and
striven, chicaned and murdered, sneaked and schemed&mdash;for
thy gold and dominion over thy people.</p>

<p>And the result? A land teeming with beings abject
and low; a land where Paradise might have been nestling
amongst the giant hills of the North, now laid
waste and desolated of its ancient splendors&mdash;a land
of dreams, but a land of unfulfilled desires. The country
of caste and the grave of unborn ambitions; the
country of dirt and superstition; the cradle of plagues
and epidemics and famines; the land of the noblest
palaces and temples, as well as of the meanest hovels
which serve as dwellings for its sad-eyed patient inhabitants.</p>

<p>And over all rises and sets the sun of the tropics,
over all shine the moon of Gautama and the stars of
Zoroaster. Over all there rest the curses of disease,
dirt and ignorance, the ready tools of greed and lust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of power, the outcome of lack of coherence and the
terrible rule of classes.</p>

<p>This cradle of humanity is still a couch of prodigious
productiveness&mdash;and to our eternal shame be it confessed&mdash;these
all-enduring, passive, gazelle-like creatures
are really white&mdash;white like we are, of the same
color as are the gay crowds of Hyde Park, or the Boulevards
of Paris, Rome or Vienna, New York or Boston!
And older as race and nearer to Eden than any of
these. They pray to Brahma and many-armed Shiva,
to Buddha and Mohammed, to the sun and fire of Zoroaster&mdash;and
even to the cobra of the jungle; but forlorn
and without hope as they seemingly are, they are
still human beings.</p>

<p>Along the dusty highway leading from Madras to
Pondisherry, well inland and therefore removed from
the life-giving breezes of the Coromandel coast and the
Bay of Bengal, under a straggling group of ficus, a
native dwelling on low stilts raises its squalid roof
above the yellow grime of its surroundings.</p>

<p>From the distant hills resounds the shrill blast of
the locomotive; every once in a while the contour of
gently rolling land permits a glimpse of a curious looking
behatted smokestack, copied after the model of
early Pacific days, belching soot and smoke, and pulling
noisily amidst groans and creaks their little dingy
cars. Along the highway the ungainly telegraph poles
with their odd crosspieces copied after the favorite gallows-construction
of remote rural England, bear witness
to the encroaching hand of western civilization on
the land. Even India is now but another source of supply
for trade and commerce.</p>

<p>Near this native structure, in the shade of a clump
of hybiscus and a few doleful fig trees, some saddle-horses
and donkeys are tethered; sprawling in the
deep weed-like grass and scrubby undergrowth a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of natives with swathed limbs and streaky, greasy
turbans are contemplating with expressionless mien the
cloudless sky in which float and soar buzzards and vultures
upon seeming motionless wings. At some distance
from this group and seated on a well-filled saddle-bag,
a European is smoking a cigarette, as if unaware
of the proximity of his humbler companions.</p>

<p>The stilted building itself, containing two compartments
separated by a narrow hallway, is made accessible
from the tangle of weeds and caked mud by a
crude ladder-like few steps of filth-covered boards.</p>

<p>Even the bounty of the tropics and wealth of vegetation
in this favored clime have not succeeded in hiding
the unattractive nakedness of the mean dwelling.
Straggling, unkempt brush and creepers but emphasize
the wild condition of its near surroundings. Rough
weathered beams, decaying boards, cracked dirty bamboo
and sunbaked grayish clay afford the only protection
against burning sun, heating wind and drifting
rain.</p>

<p>In the larger of the two compartments, which hardly
justify the appellation of rooms, two men are seated
upon a low, rough-hewn bench. In the middle of the
space an irregular heap of straw, covered with a torn
and unclean sheet of unbleached muslin, serves as a
couch upon which a man is lying prostrate&mdash;pale and
evidently very ill.</p>

<p>One of the two seated men, a dark-skinned, bright-eyed
native, heavily bearded and dressed in garments
denoting a position of high standing, rises from the
bench to kneel before the prostrate form. He holds
the unresisting wrist in his capable brown hand and
feels carefully with long prehensile fingers the pulse of
the invalid.</p>

<p>The eyes of the sick man are covered by silky lashes;
the features are calm and resigned; the nostrils expand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and contract while the native physician, machine-like,
listens and counts. Then the hand he holds is laid
gently down on the coverlet and slowly rising he beckons
to the other figure in the room to follow as he
moves towards the door.</p>

<p>This other figure, until now silent and rigid in its
vigil on the bench, sends a look of deep concern and
pity upon the recumbent young man, and follows his
companion into the adjoining space, where both retire
to the wall farthest removed from the sick youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no hope for your young friend, my lord.
The ague has weakened his frame, the drug and excess
have sapped his strength. He will die before the setting
of the sun. I shall give him a draught that will
ease his pain and hold the spirit to the last. Help I
cannot; he is beyond the power of man.&#8221;</p>

<p>His companion, a tall, lean man of fine features, and
even in his begrimed linens and dusty pith helmet a
man of importance, gave the speaker a searching look
and then bowed his head in evident grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Saklava, I know you to be a physician of
great judgment and equal skill. The governor vouches
for you and I am more than grateful to have had your
aid so promptly. If you say there is no hope, I must
cease to indulge in any. But oh&mdash;if only something
could be done!&#8221; Then in a calmer voice he continued:
&#8220;The boy is young, his constitution strong, and after
all youth clings to life! Is there truly no hope? It
means so much to me!&#8221; The Parsee remained motionless
and silent. The other went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;When I asked the governor for help he dispatched
his chief surgeon at the same time he sent for you;
Major Murdock might arrive at any moment. Will
you not await him, pray, while I go in to the boy?
How soon do you think will he awaken to consciousness?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>&#8220;In less than half an hour, my lord. And I think
his mind will be clearer; indeed he may be perfectly
rational. But his heart is very weak and his vitality
low. The next attack of fever, which I beg to assure
you cannot be prevented, will be his last, I fear. His
temperature is now as high as any man can bear and
live; his pulse is galloping and his lungs are under the
maximum tension. I shall join your man in the grove
and will await Major Murdock&#8217;s arrival. I presume
he will bring a nurse and a cot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The governor had arranged with the hospital at
Mahabalibar. Would we could have found the boy
a day sooner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord, the seed of death is in man when the seed
of life is planted. Any time during the past week
your friend&#8217;s chances would have been no better. This
district of ours is not the place for passionate youth
from foreign lands, nor is it the country where indulgence
can be committed with impunity. Our sun
is cruel, our climate is deadly. He who cares not for
his life here&mdash;is lost. Grieve not, my lord; fate has
overtaken your young friend, but he will pass out
free from pain and unconscious of the end that is inevitable.
Until later, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the deeply salaaming physician retired, his tall
companion returned with careful, noiseless step to the
sick-room and seated himself facing the sufferer.</p>

<p>His elbows on his knees and his face buried in his
palms, he contemplated the white and almost lifeless
features of the dying youth. The regular, finely
moulded face was fair like a woman&#8217;s, the proud, bold
nose, high faultless brow and beautiful, wavy, chestnut
hair, arched lips and delicate chin betokened a distinguished
and even noble ancestry. Two spots of
crimson showed on the cheeks, almost the only signs
of life, and imparted an appearance of extreme youthfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and innocence; the lips were red and bright,
the closed eyelids clear and smooth. Must the boy die?</p>

<p>This silent musing brought a flood of memories to
the motionless watcher. His eyes grew clouded, tears
gathered in them. The boy slept on insensible to the
bitter grief he was causing, unconscious of everything,
peaceful and still.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across the doorway. Brushing his
eyes the man rose quickly and cautiously passed out
to greet the new arrival. It was Major Murdock, the
surgeon, a severe-looking, stout man in undress uniform.
A few whispered words, a handshake and the
two physicians followed the tall man into the sick-room.</p>

<p>Dr. Murdock examined the sleeper&#8217;s face carefully,
thoroughly investigated chest, heart-beat, pulse and
temperature. His examination over he, in a low voice,
requested the others to join him in the primitive porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency, I can but confirm the diagnosis
and prediction of Dr. Saklava; your friend cannot be
saved. He lives but under the influence of the narcotic
that the doctor gave him, the only drug we know
which will hold life until the next fit of this awful
fever consumes it finally. Dr. Saklava has more experience
in enteric fevers than anyone in this province;
he is both competent and skillful in the knowledge and
treatment of all native diseases. You could not have
had a better physician. Your friend will pass away
with the next attack. He will regain consciousness
and there can be no harm in speaking to him. But
after his fever returns he will be delirious&mdash;and in his
weakened state neither drug nor cold bath nor nurse
can avail. Do you wish me to watch with you beside
your young friend, Count Rondell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Major, I think I will remain alone with him
and save him the shock of seeing too many strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
faces upon his awakening. He doesn&#8217;t know of my
presence, if you remember. Will you gentlemen kindly
remain within hearing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, my lord; when you want us, pray call.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parsee doctor deposited a cup and bottle upon
the bench, and after giving some whispered instructions
to the man who had been addressed as &#8220;Count,&#8221;
he followed the surgeon out of the dwelling. The
tall man resumed his post of observation.</p>

<p>The oppressive quiet of the chamber was broken
after a long interval by a sigh followed by the sound
of a slight cough. Count Rondell leaned forward
eagerly. The invalid had moved, an arm had been
thrown up and the hand was feeling for the throat.
Gradually the eyes opened and the sick man gazed
stupidly upward at the dingy mud-plastered bamboo
lace work of the ceiling, and then slowly and almost
devoid of intelligence swept the foreground and rested
curiously upon the watcher. Count Rondell half rose
as he intently observed the change, and wondered
vaguely whether he should speak or await the actions
of the sufferer.</p>

<p>The void expression of the eyes, now free of fever,
slowly yielded to one of recognition and then of shame.
A heightened color mantled the brow of the sick youth
and an elusive twitch upon the poor lips as they spoke:
&#8220;How are you, Count? So you have caught me at
last?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man flushed, sank to his knee and with both
arms extended, leaned over the invalid.</p>

<p>&#8220;God greet you, Your Highness! I am more than
happy to have found you!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice broke and he grasped the nerveless hands
of the youth before him with deep emotion, whispering
huskily, &#8220;My Prince&mdash;my boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears gathered into the now softened eyes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
sick youth. The deep feeling shown by the man kneeling
at his pallet touched him keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not grieve, dear Count! I am not worth it.
Why should you weep for me? Why should you still
extend your love and care for one so useless as I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Prince, I beseech you, do not speak thus of
yourself! Let us forget what has passed and look
forward to what is to come. I am glad to have found
you, so glad to be with you. Now, all will be, must
be, well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no, my dearest friend and guardian. No&mdash;there
is nothing to look forward to. I feel that the
end has come. I know I shall never again see my
loved ones, my land, my king. I knew it when they
brought me here. Ill as I was, I was not unconscious.
How long have I been lying here? Raise my head
so that I may look at you well&mdash;and, pray, be seated!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count gently adjusted the head and sat down.</p>

<p>For some moments not a word was spoken, then
the young man broke the stillness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear General, I have given you and all the world
a great deal of trouble, have I not? It will be all
over and done with soon&mdash;pray, don&#8217;t grieve, don&#8217;t
worry. What difference will it make to the world or
to our Roumelia if I go and another succeeds to the
throne? It could only be a worthier man whoever
he may be! Why should you waste a thought on one
who has been foolish as I have been? Why waste
time on the dreamy fool who bartered a throne, the
love and respect of a people, your friendship, Count,
for the smiles of a false woman, a wanton? Have
I not shown myself a coward? A man who after his
first failure turned tail and ran off like a sulking boy?
A good riddance I call it! Better to know the truth
now than burden a hopeful land with so worthless a
ruler. Do not weep; truly, I am not worth it!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Count Rondell, his cheeks wet with the tears that
were freely coursing down his now deathly pale face,
extended his hands imploringly. With a great effort
he recovered his calmness, and vehemently exclaimed,
&#8220;I beg of you, my Prince, do not let us harp on
actions which must have been beyond your control.
Let us rather speak of your welfare and your health.
May I ask you to look at it in this light, your Highness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, my good teacher; let it be as you will.
What do you wish me to say or tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Highness, I trust and confidently believe we
shall get you well and out of this deadly place very
soon. But you may shortly relapse into a fever and
with it into unconsciousness. I beg of your Highness
to state now what you wish to have attended to. I
ask for your commands! But first take this draught
the physician has left for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indifferently at first, but after a sip or two, with
grateful expression in his features, the invalid partook
of the drink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is good, General! I was very thirsty
without realizing it. Well, there is really not much
to tell and surely nothing to command. I am here
alone, with no obligations towards anyone. As it
possibly may be my last chance, you may want to hear
how I came to this place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg of your Highness not to tell more than you
wish. Of course I shall be glad to know your reasons
for choosing this dangerous country&#8221;&mdash;then once more
breaking down, he murmured: &#8220;Why did you, my
boy, why did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man lightly pressed the older man&#8217;s arm,
letting his hand rest upon the sleeve. Count Rondell
mutely gazed upon the suffering youth, and saw that
the boy before him knew the price he was to pay for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his folly, knew it all&mdash;and it seemed as if he wanted
to pay it. Through his mind there flitted thoughts
of the futility of man&#8217;s plans when God willed otherwise.
With this bitter reflection there came the grief
of the thought of the death of this young life that had
had no chance for fulfillment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count, the woman who made me forget my duty,
who caused me to quarrel with you and his Majesty&mdash;the
woman for whose sake I was willing to give up
honor, glory and a throne&mdash;she was nothing but a
wanton. I shall be brief. Returning one day to our
villa in Mentone, rather earlier than usual, I found
her with Monsieur Goddard, her late business manager
as I thought, in very intimate seclusion. I asked for
explanations&mdash;she laughed! The man had the best,
the only right in the world to be intimate with her&mdash;he
was her lawful husband&mdash;the only man she ever
really loved and always had loved. What cared she
for a romantic boy&mdash;a fool! He was the man who
had introduced me to her, who had aided my wooing&mdash;and
who had conspired with her to gull me! During
the months I was whispering words of love and
endearment to the woman I was craving to make my
wife, she and he were in a conspiracy to ruin me.
All they wanted was my money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humiliated and desperate, I grew reckless. How
well you knew it, my friend! How you pleaded with
me when first this great passion took hold of me!
Would I had listened to you and obeyed your wise
counsel; but it was too late. The poison of this ignoble
passion, which I mistook for the holy fire of love,
had entered my heart, had clouded my brain!</p>

<p>&#8220;After this discovery&mdash;I felt I had broken with
everything in life. As I sinned&mdash;I became reckless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick boy sank back, breathing hard and gazed
absently into space. His friend rose to soothe his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
agitation, but was arrested by an imperious motion
of the feeble hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me conclude, General. After this blow&mdash;I
chose to show that I cared not for one woman&#8217;s treachery&mdash;and
tried to prove this by publicly making love
to other women. And when one morning my valet
reported your arrival in the town, I felt that I dared
not see you, that I must flee! That day I joined the
troupe of &#8216;Le Ballet Occidental,&#8217; which was to leave
for Naples. I joined the company as the admirer of
Mademoiselle Genée, and I followed this troupe to
Alexandria and Cairo, thence to Bombay and Calcutta&mdash;and
finally to Madras.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the way to the French settlement at Pondisherry
I became very ill and they thought it best to
take me off the train and put me in charge of the hospital.
And the first night I could bear it no longer&mdash;they
wouldn&#8217;t give me morphine to ease my pain&mdash;and
I ran away&mdash;and&mdash;here I am. During all these latter
weeks I always felt and sometimes knew that you, my
dear Count, were near me&mdash;but fate was against you,
my would-be saviour&mdash;against you and with me&mdash;the
lost one&mdash;and so here I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>The last words came almost in a whisper. The
Count sat still, his forehead damp with cold perspiration.
The young man had spoken like a judge pronouncing
his own doom!</p>

<p>He could not move, he could not speak. His lips
were parched, his mind numb. He gazed at the ashen
face of the boy, at the crimson lips of the smiling,
bonny face&mdash;God, what should he do?</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, General, the last stage has been reached,&#8221;
said the youth recovering his voice. &#8220;All there is left
to do is for me to ask your forgiveness, the pardon
of his Majesty, my uncle, for all the unhappiness
caused by me. You have in the vaults of the Credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Lyonnaise at Nice my formal renunciation of all claims
to the succession and all family rights. There never
was a marriage between Madelain and me&mdash;the proofs
are with the Austrian Legation at Rome. Madelain
was paid and all my dancer and actor friends are settled
with. Come, General, be brave, be strong! Forget
me&mdash;and if you can&mdash;forgive me. You in your
wisdom will find a way to alter the succession, perhaps
my little sister can secure the dynasty. Come,
be cheerful, and do not grieve. It is but a worthless
life that is about to pass out&mdash;I have lived my life&mdash;and
lost. May God forgive me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The hand clutching the arm of the General fell
back. The Count, in his agitation, mumbled terms
of love and endearment as he eased the sick boy upon
the mean couch&mdash;but the youth had swooned. Quivering
and faint he hastened to the porch and summoned
the physicians.</p>

<p>They came quickly, the Parsee first, who bent
over the prostrate form. A light touch upon the sick
youth&#8217;s chest and brow and Doctor Saklava announced
the fit of fever had returned. He begged the Count
to retire to the adjoining room or outdoors. Nothing
could be done; he would watch and render all the
help needed.</p>

<p>With the sinking of that day&#8217;s sun, in the meager
light of a battered lantern, and attended by the doctors
and servants, General Rondell knelt by the couch
of straw and closed forever the eyes of the boy who
was to have been his king&mdash;but who had willed it
otherwise. The falling darkness found a sad cavalcade
slowly riding back to Madras, carrying all that
remained of one of the world&#8217;s chosen. And the tall,
sorrow-stricken man rode on alone behind and found
no balm for his broken heart in his thoughts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">A NARROW strip of haze above the western
horizon obscures the coastline and dims the
burning rays of the setting sun. The blood-red
ball, just visible above that indefinite line where ocean,
sky and land might meet, burnishes the lazy leaden
waves of the sea, oily and sluggish as if affected by
the oppressive heat. Purples and blues, reds and greens
vie with each other in a seeming desire to extinguish
the burnt orange which fades but slowly and reluctantly.
Everywhere reigns the deep dusky yellow
heat, with an utter absence of either sound or motion.</p>

<p>It is as if a thick sheet of glass had been interposed
between the observer and the rest of creation, with
nothing tangible, nothing real except the one all-prevailing
sensation of oppressive heat.</p>

<p>The P. &amp; O. liner gliding through the fiery molten
bronze seems as if it were &#8220;a painted ship on a painted
sea&#8221;; its motion barely perceptible, like that of a phantom
ship, the wake in its path but a feeble streak in
the dull coloring, and the funnels reluctantly and faintly
releasing a timid cone of hazy smudge.</p>

<p>Dimly outlined against the Northeast the slowly receding
line of grayish ochre marks the mute sentinels
of Arabia; to the West a heavy bank of sienna-edged
clouds veils the shore of Dana Kill and the African
hill desert.</p>

<p>On the aft deck are grouped in nondescript neglect
a few men in the uniforms of British East India
troops. A stolid, swarthy Sikh and some lean Bengals
with their patient, gentle eyes, clad in filthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
though picturesque garments, huddle in the shade of
dirty awnings. Forward, the solitary figure of the
watch drowsily moves with halting nerveless steps
in the narrow confines of his little realm. All is pervaded
by quiet and repose, a sort of fatalistic waiting
for the cooler evening.</p>

<p>A man reclining in a steamer chair on the hurricane
deck is the one human being on the upper structure
of the vessel. He is a slender sunburnt man past
middle age with commanding features and a close-cropped
beard flecked with gray. He is well groomed
in immaculate white flannels. The half-hidden gray
fathomless eyes, created to observe and to remain discreet,
the fine mouth closely compressed, the long slender
hands idly crossed on his knees, he sits seemingly
as if in a dream.</p>

<p>He strikes a close observer as one who could not
easily be overlooked in any gathering. His face would
remain in the memory&mdash;a face of one born to direct
the thought and work of others, to lead and command.
It shows the marks of the inroads of time and care,
the severe pallor of weariness beneath the tan of exposure.
His posture betrays the soldier beaten in life&#8217;s
battle.</p>

<p>A nearby cabin door is opened and a pleasant-faced
young man in the uniform of a ship&#8217;s officer steps
toward the dreamer.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you feel on this hot afternoon, Your Excellency?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dreamer turns with a smile and replies, &#8220;Very
well indeed, but a little lazy. Won&#8217;t you sit down a
minute, doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Excellency.&#8221; Dr. Brown, the ship&#8217;s
surgeon, with a little nervous motion and a quiet apology,
draws a camp-stool near and seats himself facing
the older man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;I have completed the examination and analysis
which my limited equipment permits, Count. I have
read up the case and I should like to make my report.
You know that my practice of late years has been restricted
to the traveling public, but I feel I am competent
to diagnose fairly accurately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear doctor, I have the fullest confidence in
your judgment,&#8221; with a deprecating gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say that owing to your sojourn in that
confounded India your case has been considerably aggravated
and has become more severe; it is not now
acute or at all serious, but requires careful attention.
Avoid excitement and do not undertake anything
which will strain your physical powers. I regret that
I must be strict with you with regard to your diet and
habits. But when you arrive at Brindisi, go to Karlsbad,
and in a few weeks you&#8217;ll be well enough to take
up the affairs of your country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, doctor. But to me time means the
trust and perhaps the fate of others. It is, therefore,
more than a question of self. Doctor, how long do
you give me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor flushed and looked pained. &#8220;Count, you
must believe what I have said. I will not hide from
you that you are in a serious condition but&mdash;once you
get on land and out of this floating inferno, you&#8217;ll be
as well as ever, I think. Don&#8217;t attempt to do too much
now and don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you most sincerely, doctor. Well, I suppose
even a diplomat can live plainly and give up wine
and tobacco.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bade the doctor a pleasant &#8220;au revoir&#8221; and sauntered
toward the ship&#8217;s side. In deep thought he leaned
against the railing, gazing into the now fiery sienna
of the horizon. The smile on his lips faded, his assumed
indifference had left him. Deep lines of care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
contracted his brow and the eyes looked troubled and
sad.</p>

<p>A quick step and a cheerful voice called out heartily,
&#8220;Good evening, Excellency! Dreaming or thinking&mdash;or
both?&#8221;</p>

<p>Heavily set, smooth-faced and jovial, Captain Pollard
of the ship walked toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Captain, I am only too glad to have you
break in on my dreams. They were not the rosiest
just now, even though the evening looks beautiful
enough to charm an anchorite.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Captain nodded his head. &#8220;That red sky is
rather a promise of another hot day for to-morrow,
Count. In a few hours we&#8217;ll be in the Red Sea, the
furnace of creation. I am afraid to-morrow will be
a broiler. Look, Count, there to our left is the Ras
Séan with the cloud wreath on top of him. In an
hour we shall be in &#8216;Bab El Mandeb,&#8217; the Gate of
Dirge of the Arab. Gloomy premonition, I call that.
We are going fine and are ahead of our schedule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Malone, what is it?&#8221; This to the
officer of the deck who was rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pilot is signalling from Tadshurra Bay, sir.
Shall I slow down, Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir, glad to get him promptly. What
is the boat&#8217;s number?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, that is old Abdullah, a good sailor and a
fine fellow. Report when he gets aboard, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer hurried away and shortly after the siren
gave two short blasts and the boat lost headway.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I join you for a bit, Count?&#8221; Captain Pollard
took the stool vacated by the doctor following
the gesture of polite assent of the Count.</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor&#8217;s report left a bad taste in your mouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
eh? If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like to say a few words
more on this same subject, your Excellency.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Captain stuck his hands deeply into his coat
pockets, looking straight at the Count. &#8220;You are an
old soldier and a gentleman who knows the world,
Count. Dr. Brown came to me this afternoon somewhat
worried. He doesn&#8217;t want to scare you needlessly
but neither does he intend you should get off
the boat a sick man. He is probably a little over-cautious.
Now, just to please us all, let him look after
you until we land. There is nothing more trying after
a residence in India than the passage we have ahead
of us for the next five or six days. Do as Dr. Brown
advises and when you get home send him a nice letter
telling him he was right. Is it a bargain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Captain, it certainly is; and I appreciate
your interest very much and won&#8217;t fail you and the
good doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had regained his smiling manner: &#8220;Captain,
why are we men such restless wanderers? You could
settle down in your nice little cottage at Bournemouth,
draw your pension, trim your apple trees, read your
old friend Marryat, chat with Mrs. Pollard and curse
the Liberal Party; and I&mdash;I could write my memoirs,
raise tulips and roses and blooded sheep, sneer at the
Radicals and Progressives, and criticize the weak policy
of the Hapsburgs! What fun we could have,
Hein?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency, I guess we both do what we believe
to be our duty. Neither of us is good at idling,
I think, and our work is our life. Some day I might
do as you say&mdash;but I hope that day is a long way off,&#8221;
with a merry chuckle.</p>

<p>A crunching sound against the ship&#8217;s side and the
pilot&#8217;s dingy pulled by two powerful negroes had come
alongside. With the pilot two other figures were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
visible in the dim light. The nimble, old, beturbaned
Arab pilot, with broad red sash around his ample waist,
swung himself aboard, the two men following him.</p>

<p>On the upper deck the conversation which had
lagged during this busy interval was further interrupted
by the approach of a steward in search of the
Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two passengers boarded with the pilot, sir. One
of them requests permission to speak to you for a
minute, Captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the purser seen him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; but he asked for you; he says you know
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, send him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The steward left and shortly after a heavily bearded,
well-set-up, broad-shouldered man, in rather shabby
linen blouse and baggy trousers, a pith helmet in hand,
walked towards the Captain. In the rapidly failing
light the deeply tanned features with calm eyes and
pleasant smile were just visible. With hand outstretched
he stepped up to the group and in a hearty
voice exclaimed: &#8220;How do you do, Captain Pollard!
I was most anxious to meet an old friend again and
couldn&#8217;t wait. Don&#8217;t you remember me, Captain?
The clothes and beard make it hard, I guess. I am
John Morton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless my soul, I wouldn&#8217;t have known you!
My dear Mr. Morton, I am delighted to see you!&#8221;
He shook the visitor&#8217;s hand heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but you do look like a globe trotter&mdash;and one
that has done some trotting! It is good to shake hands
with you once more and to have you on the &#8216;Hindoostan.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, indeed, glad to have the chance to get your
boat, Captain. From my last camp the bay was easier
to make than the upper Nile, and when I found at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Aa-nin that you were expected to-night, I made a run
for the shore and was just in time for the pilot&#8217;s sloop.
I haven&#8217;t been near civilization in eighteen months,
Captain! I have with me my man, Donald, whom
you may remember. He looks, if anything, even worse
for wear than I. May I see you again after the cleaning-up
process, Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, my dear Mr. Morton. I shall be delighted
if you will honor me. I am as curious as an
old magpie to hear what brought you here of all spots
in the world! Are you nicely placed aboard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a movement to withdraw but Captain Pollard
took him by the arm and led him towards the
Count.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency, will you permit me? This is Mr.
Morton, an old friend of mine, an American gentleman
who is quite a traveler and explorer&mdash;his Excellency
Count Rondell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy to make your acquaintance, Your Excellency;
I trust you will pardon my appearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very glad to meet you, Mr. Morton. Don&#8217;t apologize.
You look fit and ready for good sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men shook hands. Morton stepped back:
&#8220;Gentlemen, permit me to retire. I trust I shall have
the honor later, Your Excellency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes one of the finest young men,&#8221; said the
Captain, looking after the rapidly retiring form, &#8220;a
man in a million, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks keen and strong; a bold man and true,&#8221;
gently said the Count with almost a sigh. &#8220;Sportsman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know, Count. I think he went out
to explore the Soudan and the Blue Nile country, if
I remember correctly. He comes of a very fine family&mdash;a
man of rare good judgment and the very man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
have around when trouble is brewing. Some time I
will tell you how I met him. If you&#8217;ll permit me,
Count, I&#8217;ll now look up that pilot. We are getting
under way. Good evening, Excellency!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Au revoir, Captain. I shall have to interview the
chief steward and see if Dr. Brown will allow me
another meal to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that he was once again alone, the Count forgot
the evening meal, forgot the steward and the man
he just had met&mdash;he had weightier matters on his
mind. This man of the world, trained to think while
chatting and seemingly enjoying small talk&mdash;this old
diplomat realized that he had arrived at a parting of
the ways. The oppressive heat of earlier day had
yielded somewhat to the gentle breeze rising from the
ever-nearing mountainous shore. A brilliant crimson
band silhouetted sharply the deep purple of Ras Séan,
the bluish haze half hid the frowning abrupt cliffs of
Perim Island; the first twinkle of the lighthouse shone
like a firefly, coming and going in rhythmic flashes.
To the north the broad dome of Disohebel Menghéli
rose high, the towering guardian of the strait, the
dread of the unwary skipper. Over the ultramarine
hills rose the red moon of the silent East, mysterious
and alluring, the light of the romantic night. Count
Rondell, obeying the promptings of weary limbs, sank
into his seat and gazed as if fascinated into the glory
of the tropical eve.</p>

<p>The world was so beautiful and life so promising!
Moments of the years gone by passed in rapid succession
through his mind; the days of youth and hope&mdash;the
years of ambition and fulfillment. The shadows
of beloved faces rose to disappear; the joy of deeds
performed, the regret of acts omitted. As in a panorama
he saw his life over again and lived it once more.</p>

<p>A flock of buzzards flying across the hazy light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the moon that looked for all the world like a flattened
giant orange, by a curious disconnection of the phenomenon
so well known to him, awoke him to the
present; to the warning he had received, to the call
of a life which was to end. A slight tremor passed
over the frame of the man, who seemed to have aged
considerably within the last hour.</p>

<p>The training of decades, the inbred desire to suppress
thoughts and control the mind, supervened. He
lightly passed his hand over the smoothening brow,
caressing the thick hair upon his temple and the old
gentle smile appeared again in his eyes. &#8220;Well, I
have run a long race&mdash;and on the homestretch I am
beaten. <i>Vivat sequens!</i>&#8221; he whispered to himself.</p>

<p>He rose and walked freely to the rail, contemplating
the wondrous evening, admiring the marvelous light
effects in the now rapidly darkening sky. He gazed
at the minute wavelets springing from the sides of the
boat and spreading their gory crests endlessly toward
the east, ever widening and disappearing in purplish
black shadows. The first stars as if by magic had
leaped upon the zenith, new born, blinking mockingly
to him.</p>

<p>A smile gentler than before illuminated the fine features.
&#8220;God is great, nature is full of wonders, and
I shall not cry quits and sulk. There is work before
you, my boy, work and duty. And when that is done,
my beloved, I shall be glad to join you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a deep sigh and a proud smile he wearily
turned toward the line of cabins from whence a light
step now proceeded.</p>

<p>His valet came forward, cap in hand. &#8220;Your Excellency,
dinner will be ready in twenty minutes.
Will you not come to your room, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, Jean; but I believe I shall not dress
to-night. I am fatigued and I expect no one else will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Just a little touching up and a dark coat and scarf.
I shall follow you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musing, he turned once more to the waters which
had lost their mirror-like smoothness upon entering
the narrow channel. Before him rose the escarpment
of Perim&#8217;s forts, with their twinkling lights; the breeze
carried to his ears the bugle call from the barracks,
the one discordant sound in the serene stillness of the
fairy landscape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gate to an ocean&mdash;England will hold it,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;Passage to power and trade&mdash;Albion will rule
it. Other nations may strive and plan, dream and
scheme, but Albion takes and holds. I wonder if,
when my last call comes, I shall find a Briton guarding
the Pearly Gates? Well, I have done the best I could
for my king and my country. I must not grudge the
men who have done theirs for their queen and land&mdash;and
with more glorious and happier results. The race
is to the swift, the laurel to the victor, glory to the
lucky! L&#8217;homme propose, Dieu dispose!&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave one more look round, turning in all directions,
and then slowly left the deck.</p>

<p>The moon had risen above the haze and shone a
lustrous brightness. The sky, a deep unfathomable
marine, was dotted with countless blinking stars; the
shimmering sea was scales of silver; the hum of giant
machinery throbbed on the balmy air. It was a night
so glorious that one doubted if there could be anything
but beauty and happiness on earth.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;how much misery and sorrow, pain and
tears are mingled with joy in life! The lure of the
East, the mystery of dreamed-of Eden and with it
strife and labor! The nobility of creation, the pettiness
of life; the loveliness of nature, the emptiness
of man&#8217;s efforts.</p>

<p>Five bells&mdash;the Vesper on shipboard.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>The muffled call of the Muezzin from the nearby
minaret of Perim town drifted across the silvery
stream.</p>

<p>And the bells, re-echoing from fore and aft, seemed
to call out: &#8220;All&#8217;s well, good night!&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER a long, weary night, made seemingly
longer by the slow passage through the tortuous
channels, threatened by reefs and coral shallows,
the &#8220;Gate of Dirge&#8221; was passed. The pilot dropped,
the P. &amp; O. liner entered through the picturesque
Dacht il Mayum, the sluggish waves of the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Through the wondrous waters the ship cut her way
energetically. The moon had set long since, the east
was bathed in sulphur light and one by one the stars
dropped out of existence.</p>

<p>The lower decks, forsaken the evening before, are
now lively with passengers. The heat had made sleep
impossible and now, one after another, they came up
to breathe the reviving morning air.</p>

<p>What wind blows is from the starboard, but the
port side is the shadier for the greater part of the
day. It is this side which is quickly taken possession
of by the Mohammedan part of the passengers. The
gaunt Sikh, bewhiskered and beturbaned, the Persian
venders with their fierce mustachios and fiercer eyes,
shrewd-looking Syrians and fleshy Mamelukes, all congregate
or segregate according to their individual desires,
and all are bent upon their morning worship.</p>

<p>More or less gaudily colored patches of carpets and
prayer rugs are spread upon the boards, devout heads
bow down from prostrate bodies, turned to the east,
to the rising sun, to praise Allah and to pray to Mohammed
his prophet. They will turn to the east, even
though Mecca is due north of the boat!</p>

<p>On the promenade and hurricane decks a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
early risers are taking their constitutionals. On the
bridge strides the fresh-looking skipper, and a neat
second officer in glaring white is adjusting his sextant
as he awaits the sun&#8217;s coming. A few deckhands and
sailors are holystoning the decks and adjusting the
striped awnings.</p>

<p>Upon the free and lofty upper structure in the broad
space between the cabins and the captain&#8217;s quarters
some privileged travelers, to judge by the important
bearing of the men and the well-groomed appearance
of the ladies, are languidly settling themselves down.
They show scarce a sign of sleepless tossing in heated
berths. One of these, a tall, lean man in Pongee, cap
and scarf to match, bearing carefully trimmed little
chops below the grayish hair, is Sir Balingbroke-Smith,
Under-Secretary of the Colonies. He is holding forth
to his daughter Muriel on the history of the islands
which are just sinking below the southern horizon.</p>

<p>Miss Muriel endeavors to show some interest, appearing
to listen with careful attention; but her eyes
are wandering around the deck. She is waiting for
the appearance of the stranger who had come on board
the evening before and whom the Captain had discussed
at dinner. The new passenger had declined
coming to table as he needed &#8220;civilizing.&#8221; So Captain
Pollard had put it; but he was a gentleman, though an
American, who had spent the last eighteen months in
the wilds of the Soudan and the mountains of Somali,
instead of lounging at Shepard&#8217;s Hotel at Cairo or at
the Casino at Nice. He was young, rich, independent
and &#8220;as fine a chap as ever came out of Eton or Oxford,
my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Muriel seems tired or sleepy, or both,&#8221; said her
aunt and duenna, the Hon. Mrs. Fitzhugh, the wife
of an Indian officer. The good lady was returning to
winter in London to recuperate after a trying season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with her husband at Lahore, and incidentally was acting
as chaperon to Miss Muriel. The ladies of the
group duly agreed. Who would dare to differ from
her? But all are casting side glances in the direction in
which Miss Muriel insists on keeping her pretty face.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Akley, in sober gray, with solemn
face and pained, bloodshot eyes, is gazing intently at
a group of prostrated orientals, a martyr to faith and
duty. The latter, however, do not seem to mind the
sad, pained expression in the eyes of the churchman.
But even the countenance of the reverend gentleman is
somewhat askew from the vertical&mdash;since he also is
partaking in the general interest. Will this much-talked-of
young man ever make his appearance?</p>

<p>And now that the sun has risen above the slight
mist to the east, chairs are being pushed into shady
and cool places. Chatting and fussing and good-natured
pushing, the one business of the day must he attended
to first&mdash;how to avoid the heat of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is going to be beastly hot! If one could but
get one&#8217;s <i>Times</i> and know what the world is doing?
Muriel, my dear, if you insist upon taking such violent
exercise before your breakfast you will not be really
comfortable for the rest of the day. May I remind
you that the next few days are the most trying of the
voyage and that the best means to make it bearable&mdash;would
be&mdash;a-a-absolute rest&mdash;very little food and
liquid refreshments?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Balingbroke was very impressive. As breakfast
had been mentioned by so high an authority as the
Under-Secretary of the Colonies, the subject became
now the general topic of conversation.</p>

<p>But the ladies managed to turn it into a more interesting
channel, and Sir Balingbroke was gradually
drawn into speaking of the new passenger whom he
had met in the smoking room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>&#8220;A very estimable young man, I believe; Captain
Pollard tells me that he met him on transatlantic liners&mdash;he
says he is a well-connected, affluent American&mdash;a
Mr. Morton, I think; quite refined and unassuming.
I understand he has been engaged on some exploring
or observation work in southern Egypt and the adjacent
territory. It may be&mdash;semi-officially of course&mdash;that
he is under the wings of the Royal Geographical
Society. He mentioned that Lord Salisbury was kind
enough to recommend him to the authorities&mdash;expects
to go to London to report the results of his research.
Very nice fellow, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eight bells, and shortly after the gong sounds for
breakfast&mdash;the first important function of the day.
The little coterie gathered on the forepart of the deck
abandon chairs and troop down to the dining saloon.</p>

<p>In the saloon Mr. Morton was duly presented to
the ladies at the Captain&#8217;s table and to a few of the
gentlemen to whom he had not been introduced the
evening before in the &#8220;smoker.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Hon. Mrs. Fitzhugh sarcastically remarked that
there were still some men who were old-fashioned
enough to remain on deck with the ladies after dinner&mdash;denying
themselves their whiskey and soda. The
men thus referred to tried to look pleased, but those
who had sinned did not seem to mind the lady&#8217;s sarcasm.</p>

<p>Captain Pollard was evidently taking great pains
to impress those sitting around the table that Mr.
Morton was a man of importance. He singled him
out in conversation and gave marked attention to what
the traveler said. On a liner everyone takes his cue
from the captain, and the American immediately became
a full fledged member of the select coterie.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton frankly and almost boyishly admitted
his delight at being once more in civilized surroundings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
He smilingly pleaded guilty to an enjoyment of
the society of ladies and hoped that his manners had
not deteriorated. The ladies were charmed with him.
He was good to look at and his pleasant voice and delightfully
sympathetic smile won them over completely.
His ignorance of the news of the day afforded them
an opportunity for further conversation, and he
listened with an old-world courtesy that only educated
Americans show to their women. The ladies
lionized him.</p>

<p>To the many inquiries about his adventures in the
desert, he answered good-naturedly and in a rather
off-hand way. Life in the desert had its interesting
side and the months he had spent there had enabled
him to gather valuable data which he expected to apply
to work in the Great Basin of his own country,
where his father and the federal government were
interested in the question of irrigation. There had
not been much danger in his adventures, for the natives
were human and rather helpful than otherwise.</p>

<p>As he sat at table enjoying anew the amenities of
civilized society, Morton confessed to himself that
really the most important thing to him was the stimulating
and pleasant expectation of being soon home
again among his own people, with his dear mother
and fine-souled, humor-loving father. How pleased
and happy they would be to have him with them again!
How jolly to sit once more in the cozy den, his friends
and loved ones listening to his tales of adventure!
Unconsciously his mind wandered to scenes of his intimate
family circle. When the longing heart travels
homeward, the half-way inns are but little conveniences
on the journey; we take advantage of them because
we must; always the heart&#8217;s eye looks longingly
forward to its goal&mdash;home. His little sister&mdash;by
George, she would be a young woman now, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
blue-eyed, clear-skinned English girl across the table,
and better looking, if the promise of earlier remembrance
was to be fulfilled. Two years do make a great
change!</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;he must stop off at Paris for a couple of days
and buy his sister and mother something worth bringing
home. His heart grew warm as he pictured their
happy eyes and heard their pleased exclamations. And
his father! Won&#8217;t the governor be proud of the reports
he was bringing back. Figures don&#8217;t lie, his
father used to say. And what else should he bring
him? Yes&mdash;he would have to go to London, too.</p>

<p>He hoped the fine old Nubian sarcophagus which
he had shipped by stealth from Assab by the old rascal
Ben Bandar (the old chap surely dealt in slaves on
the sly) on a Greek sailing vessel had reached New
York safely. What would his neighbor, Sir Balingbroke,
have said if he knew that the Egyptian custom-house
servants were the same old grafters they had
been before Alexandria was bombarded and the Khedive
all powerful on the Nile?</p>

<p>Almost with a start he awoke to his surroundings,
mumbling some words of apology for his absent-mindedness.
Mrs. Fitzhugh had addressed some remarks
to him&mdash;Miss Muriel&#8217;s eyes were dancing as
she smiled wickedly at him. Mrs. Fitzhugh haughtily
forgave him.</p>

<p>This meeting at the table was the type of many
others which took place during the next days, varied
with some small talk on deck, and broken by some
lengthier and more interesting conversations in the
smoking room.</p>

<p>Whether the ladies approved or not, the shady
depths of the small &#8220;smoker&#8221; on the upper deck proved
a veritable Mecca for all the men. Here one always
was pretty sure to find some of the passengers enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
their cigars or cigarettes or even pipes, chatting
of trade and drinks, horses and games, politics
and policies.</p>

<p>Here was to be found the man who could foretell
the number of knots the boat would cover that day;
who knew the hour they would sight the African shore
again. Another would descant of the ever-inspiring
topic&mdash;the great Canal&mdash;the time it took to go through
it, the money a boat had to pay, the advantages of
being on a British boat and so on.</p>

<p>Here also it was where Jones told of Smith&#8217;s affairs
while the latter was with the ladies, where Smith in
turn was telling what Jones had been doing in India
when the last-named gentleman had to obey the call
of his better half and absent himself from the round
table. It was not long, therefore, before everyone
knew all about everybody else; or, at least, thought
they did.</p>

<p>For Morton and some of the older men there was
the evening gathering in the Captain&#8217;s roomy cabin,
the exchange of tales and adventures with the jolly-faced
seaman and the recital of some traveler&#8217;s tale of
older days by some visitor.</p>

<p>From the Captain, Morton obtained his information
about Count Rondell, who had once been the Captain&#8217;s
superior officer some years back, when the latter had
been in the service of Roumelia as a nautical instructor.</p>

<p>He heard from Sir Balingbroke how, during the
memorable days of the Congress of Berlin, Count Rondell,
then at the head of the diplomatic corps of his
little country, fought hard and unremittingly for admission
to the inner chambers of the historic conference,
and how, in spite of the weighty opposition of
Giers and the fact that he could not get official admission
as a delegate, he had so won the esteem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
all the statesmen there present that he had secured full
independence, autonomy and great economic advantages
for his country, and, then and there, had laid
the foundation of the kingdom of Roumelia.</p>

<p>From this austere and cautious member of the British
cabinet he also learned of the Count&#8217;s romantic
quest in eastern lands for the young prince who had
disappeared from home, and how necessary this only
heir to the throne was for the continuance of existing
conditions in the little kingdom. But Sir Balingbroke
could not say whether the Count&#8217;s search had been
crowned with success or not.</p>

<p>Captain Pollard pictured the Count as a man of unbending
character, thoroughly upright and just. A
man who ruled at court with iron hand but who had
remained unsullied by its machinations&mdash;an aristocrat
in office, a student and loving husband in his home.
Sir Balingbroke nodded his head emphatically by way
of confirmation of the Captain&#8217;s statements.</p>

<p>Morton spent considerable time in his own cabin,
tabulating his collected material with the help of his
assistant. During his absence from the ship&#8217;s circle
he was largely discussed. The ladies especially were
eager for information.</p>

<p>All the skipper knew, it seemed, was that Mr. Morton
was the only son of Daniel B. Morton, the Arizona
Copper King, one of the wealthiest and most influential
of the many powerful men which America&#8217;s
mineral wealth had created during the last decades.
Young Morton was said to be a chip of the old block,
well educated, manly and straight. After his college
days at home, he had pursued special post-graduate
studies at Oxford and Bonn, and had prepared himself
to take up his father&#8217;s work. The Captain couldn&#8217;t
explain why the young man had gone seemingly on
a new tack. Rich as Croesus and living in a tent with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
no one but a man servant for over a year! Sir Balingbroke
was puzzled.</p>

<p>Count Rondell was the least regular attendant at
the Captain&#8217;s board. The latter explained that the
Count&#8217;s health was not good. Dr. Brown had so reported
to him.</p>

<p>Thus the days of heat and monotony stretched their
weary lengths. They passed the harbor of Dshidda
with its many picturesque boats, from little catamarans
to large clumsy steamers. On the southern horizon
disappeared also the rocks of Yanbu Bar, Sudan,
Suakim and Loheia. On the fifth day after Morton
had boarded the liner, when the sea once more showed
the fiery red of sunset, they reached the head of the
Gulf of Suez and the ship slid carefully into the basin
which marks the southern terminal of the great Canal.</p>

<p>From Suez town the lights shot their sporadic blinking;
the great tangle of boats of all descriptions and
sizes tied up in the basin and adjoining docks began
to show their mast lights and port lamps; the lighthouse
on the narrow tongue of land stretching into
the shadowy bay sent out its rhythmic signal flashes.</p>

<p>Morton, sitting opposite Count Rondell, gratefully
leaned back in his flattened steamer chair and remarked:
&#8220;What a relief to be so far north and at
last on the eve of leaving this insufferable quarter
of the world! I am glad to see a town once more, glad
to see lights and real streets and hear real human
noises even if they are as hideous as these are. It is
good to look up to the heavens of our own familiar
constellations and find our polar star promising the arrival
home. See, Count, there, for the first time, can
be distinguished all the stars of the Big Dipper! The
Southern Cross is glorious, and I have admired it
during many soundless nights in the desert; but give
me our own starry sky, our own air, my own people!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Count Rondell looked up with a smile. &#8220;To tell
you the truth, my dear sir, I have traveled along latitudes
I never expected to see and I barely noticed the
Southern Cross. I certainly must be getting old and
unobservant. But I can appreciate how you feel when
you think of the loved ones who are waiting for you
in your distant country, and to know that your coming
home means so much happiness to them. I also
am glad to see again the stars of the north&mdash;my stars&mdash;though
I am returning with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot help thinking,&#8221; added the Count, &#8220;of the
part this waterway has played in the history of the
world&#8217;s civilization. I see it as the highway of the
trend westward of our humanity&#8217;s progress. You will
recall, Mr. Morton, that in the dawn of civilization the
traders of Egypt brought their spices and gold and
ivory from India. They resigned their profitable trading
to the shrewder Phoenician sailors who were followed
by those of Syracuse and Carthage. Then came
in the Middle Ages the merchant princes of the Venetian,
Pisan and Genoese republics.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a marine from this lost city who, with the aid
of Spanish gold, discovered your own country when
the trade of the then known world had already drifted
into the hands of the enterprising people of the Hisparian
peninsula. We know what the aggrieved Portuguese
and the stolid Dutch contributed to this westward
march; but then had to yield, in their lives, to
the superior gifts and stronger physique of the English
race.</p>

<p>&#8220;Always it has been the cry of the &#8216;Westward Ho!&#8217;
And it always will be so. It would seem as if man
could not resist following the path of the sun. Your
people, Mr. Morton, your country will now step into
the heritage of the world&#8217;s commerce. I am sure of
it. It is the will of destiny.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Morton looked at the speaker with a feeling of awe.
The thought so clearly developed was entirely new to
him, and he had no answer to make.</p>

<p>A bond of mutual sympathy had grown up between
the two men, so divergent in their aims and ambitions,
so far apart in their ages. The younger admired the
poise, the gentle courtesy and faultless manner of the
elder. He admired his freedom from prejudice, his
absolute toleration of the failings and frailties of
others, and his prompt, unqualified condemnation of
everything wrong, cowardly and selfish.</p>

<p>The older man on his part had become strangely attached
to this virile, modest young man with his quiet
calm ways, his broad and sound judgment of men and
things and his democratic heartiness, which Morton
possessed with all his seeming indifference towards
others. An affection truly paternal had been awakened
in him for this American who could not fail to represent
to him a national type. He had met but few of
his kind and had to confess to himself that in the past
he had wronged them by his opinion. An American
had meant to him an overaggressive boor; but in this
young Morton he found as fine a gentleman as even
he could wish for, a man also without the flaws of artificial
mannerisms.</p>

<p>He could not help comparing him to the youthful
prince who, by failing to suppress a morbid tendency
to resist authority and restraint, had brought such fatal
consequences upon himself and his country. &#8220;Why
couldn&#8217;t this clean-cut young man have been of the
line of the King&#8217;s dynasty?&#8221; he asked himself despairingly.</p>

<p>The subject discussed by the two had been of a
broad character and general interest. Just before the
interruption caused by the sight of land, they had
been talking about the great similarity in the desires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and aims of all people. Morton, who had intimated
that his isolation in the desert had been somewhat of
an intentional retirement to study himself and his own
duty toward his country, had expressed himself in
ways highly interesting to his companion. Returning
to the subject, Morton said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is remarkable that the seeming great differences
between races and tribes are but outward
and rather in their customs and habits than
in their mental processes. I believe that the established
use of the dromedary as a beast of
burden, the necessity of living in tents owing to the
absence of water courses and springs, the diet of fruits
and sweetmeats, are really the things that remove
the Arabs of Africa from the Europeans far more than
their actual thoughts, their ambitions and emotions.
These outward signs are what, next to language, strike
us first as distinguishing marks. Once we get over
these, to me at least, minor characteristics, it is surprising
how easy it would be to trace the course of
their thoughts, their actions, as running on lines almost
similar to those that actuate the Frenchman or
Italian or even the man from more northern countries.
I have found love of truth, manliness and honesty,
pride of descent, loyalty to kindred, affection for one&#8217;s
own offspring, appreciation of learning, strong traits
with these primitive men; while gluttony, drunkenness
or license in almost any form is entirely absent from
the nature of these children of the desert.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rondell had listened with close attention to
Morton&#8217;s remarks. &#8220;There is no doubt,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;much truth in your observation, my friend. To me
it has ever been a matter for wonder how short the
step is from the highest to the lowest. I am a member
of a proud aristocracy and have been called the
&#8216;Kingmaker,&#8217; and yet I confess that beneath the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
skin of manners and polished bearing there is often
but common clay&mdash;indeed, the common man frequently
gains by being compared to his more exalted brother.
I remember,&#8221; he continued, thoughtfully, &#8220;our party
was very much entertained in Paris by the fine play
of a small band of Gypsies then performing at our
favorite restaurant. One evening, while giving the
customary <i>douceur</i> to the leader, I asked him for his
address as it was my intention to engage his orchestra
for some small affair. The man could not write, and
he asked me to put his address into my memorandum
book. He owned but a single name. His pockmarked
face, his little beetle eyes and low forehead gave but
scant promise of intelligence. I asked him some questions
about his life and ambitions&mdash;the man grew quite
loquacious. He liked France and the French. He
made a nice living, he had saved quite some money,
had a good and thrifty wife, a cozy apartment and
many comforts. The one thing which marred his
happiness was the sad fact that his marriage had
proved childless. The &#8216;bon Dieu&#8217; had not blessed
them. But for that he would not change with the manager
of the hotel or any other man in Paris! I was
deeply impressed because my own king had said the
same words to me. But still, my dear Mr. Morton,
blood will tell. And a nobleman is the product of
many generations of thought, virtue and manliness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton nodded thoughtfully as he lighted a cigar.
Both remained silent. From the shore came the sounds
of murmuring crowds, the splashing of oars, the shrill
tones of muleteers and the hoarse laughter of negroes.
Then followed the clanking of chains, the straining of
ropes, a few short commands from the bridge and the
anchors had dropped.</p>

<p>Everyone was delighted to have reached another
milestone in the long journey home. Passengers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
discussing as to whether they should continue in the
&#8220;Hindoostan&#8221; or take the night train to Ishmaila or
Alexandria. Perhaps there might be some excitement
in Suez, or at Port Said? Congestion of traffic in
those days delayed the passage through the Canal and
even the P. &amp; O. liner might lose two days.</p>

<p>Stewards passed back and forth, in and out of saloons,
and announced, in loud voices and in intonations
ranging from Cockney to the resonant drawl of
Aberdeen, &#8220;Mail distributed in Purser&#8217;s office at 6.30.&#8221;
One, more respectful than the rest, approached the
Count, &#8220;Your Excellency, the chief has cables for you;
shall I bring them to you?&#8221; The Count rose and with
a courteous leave went to the purser&#8217;s cabin.</p>

<p>Morton, to whom the sights were not novel, leaned
over the starboard side, looking toward the quiet dark
waters of the bay. He thought over the past few days
of his life on shipboard, the acquaintances he had
made, and the new experiences that had come to him.
How strange these all were! What would they mean
to him in after years? Then thoughts of home surged
over him, and a great longing seized him to be there
again. If he took the express boat from Alexandria
he would be in Brindisi in time to take the train for
Paris&mdash;and then London, and then the Cunarder for
home&mdash;New York by the twentieth&mdash;and a whole
month before Christmas! Christmas&mdash;and the snow!
He&#8217;d cable and advise his folks. No, perhaps he&#8217;d
better wait for his mail. His eyes wandered back to
the deck below and saw his man leaning against the
bulwark. He gave a low whistle and addressed the
upturned face: &#8220;Don, I am going down to get the mail.
Shall I bring you yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allright, Mr. John, thank you. There won&#8217;t be
much to carry when you get it, I guess. Haven&#8217;t
many correspondents these days.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you in the smoker, Don.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mail he received was more voluminous than he
had expected. There were several letters, some with
dates months back, and a cable.</p>

<p>He retired into a quiet corner of the smoking room.
Don was there and handing him one lean looking letter,
he excused himself and broke the seal of the cable.
It was but one day old. &#8220;Glad know you out of desert
well and homeward bound. Mother sister well. Send
love. Am not very well myself. Better hurry home,
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mechanically he looked for the signature which was
lacking. It seemed less personal without his father&#8217;s
name, and he was puzzled that his father had not used
the code.</p>

<p>The letters contained nothing but good tidings.
There was no reference to his father&#8217;s health except
in the one from his mother bearing the latest date.
She wrote: &#8220;Father seems quieter than usual and somewhat
restless. Nothing wrong but the doctor advises
putting off his usual trip to the Rockies for the present
and would like to see him go South before the cold
weather sets in. We expect to leave Bar Harbor
earlier than usual and go to Cleveland before the
middle of October as father would be more happy if
we joined him there. If you, my dear boy, could get
home in time, we might spend Christmas in California
together and for once escape the cold of the
lakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton grew pensive; he had never before given a
thought to his father&#8217;s health. His father had always
seemed to him as young as ever and a more rugged
and sturdy man, a man of better habits could not be
found. He hoped the plaintive word meant nothing&mdash;nothing
but the longing of the old man for his son.
Still&mdash;he guessed it was time for him to step in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
ease the governor&#8217;s burden. After all&mdash;what better
work could he do?</p>

<p>He lay back, smoking and dreaming, somewhat in
revival of his solitary habits of the past months, and
abandoned himself once more to the charm of being
alone&mdash;alone with his thoughts and removed from
undesired companionship.</p>

<p>After an hour or so he rose and went to his cabin,
where he threw himself on his couch. Unable to rest,
he busied himself with a survey of his few belongings
that might need packing. Then nervously drawing up
a table he began working on his report. But he could
not collect his thoughts. Evidently he was not in the
humor. He was about to put his things away preparatory
to trying once more the darkened deck, when
the door opened and a steward entered with a note.</p>

<p>In the envelope he found a card bearing the inscription:</p>



<p class="center">&#8220;Count Arnim Barton-Rondell.&#8221;</p>

<p>and on the reverse side in a precise clear handwriting,
&#8220;May I request you to call at my cabin at your convenience?&mdash;Rondell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton hesitated but an instant. &#8220;Tell his Excellency
I shall be with him right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anything was better than this moping, and the
Count was the very companion to brush away the cobwebs
from his mind. He stuffed his papers into the
nearest table drawer, gave a cursory examination to
his appearance before the mirror, locked his cabin door
and sauntered over to the Count&#8217;s quarters.</p>

<p>Why had Count Rondell sent for him? He wondered.</p>







<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Morton entered Count Rondell&#8217;s stateroom
he found him standing behind a small
flat desk in the middle of the room, his commanding,
almost gaunt figure erect and tense. As he
looked at the man, he experienced the same peculiar
sensation he had felt upon receipt of the message asking
him to call&mdash;a sense of indefinable anxiety mingled
with curiosity.</p>

<p>In response to an expressive motion of the slender
pale hands he seated himself opposite the Count. His
eyes slowly traveled around the stateroom and noted
its appearance in some detail.</p>

<p>Two swinging bracket lamps lit up the wall to his
right, leaving the lower part of the room in deep
shadow. The stateroom itself, somewhat roomier
than the customary steamer cabin, had been transformed
into a rather pleasing den. Along the lighted
walls a low couch in some dark plush was enlivened
by the brilliant coloring of a leopard skin thrown carelessly
over the back and by a saddle-bag in bright
crimson and gold. Above it were fastened a garniture
of Persian helmet, shield and battle-axe, the gold
inlay upon the damascene scintillating in the slightly
moving light which fell upon it.</p>

<p>The floor, covered with a soft rug in deep maroon
and with tan arabesques in design, contrasted oddly
with the green baize of the traveling desk piled with
books and portefeuilles. A curiously wrought bronze
lamp shed a bright circle of light over it; an unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
article of furniture, it struck Morton, to take on a
voyage. It was a handsome thing and he made a
mental note to obtain one like it. His glance now
rested upon the figure and face of the Count, who had
sat himself in his deep, low chair and was resting his
hands upon his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will forgive an old and ailing man, my dear
Mr. Morton, for making the most of his privileges as
such. I trust my request to have you call has not inconvenienced
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, Excellency; I was glad to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. It may not be considerate of me to
ask you here&mdash;but I believe you won&#8217;t mind the limited
space and closed portholes. I imagine your camp
life has accustomed you to a great extent to discomfort
and heat. What I want to say to you demands privacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and continued. &#8220;Mr. Morton, I beg you
to permit me to approach what I wish to say in my
own way, even if it may seem odd and unwarranted
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Your Excellency, I am listening.&#8221;</p>

<p>The older man leaned back and pushed a box of
cigars toward his visitor. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you take one? I
think you will like the flavor.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice, until now somewhat strained, had become
calm, and with an assumed nonchalance of manner,
he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was told by the steward, Mr. Morton, that you
had received considerable mail and some cables upon
our arrival here. Does the receipt of these in any way
alter your plans, which you were so good as to intimate
to me the other evening? Pardon the question, but it
is necessary that I should know in view of what I
wish to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does, Your Excellency. My letters from home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
are of little moment, but a cable, sent some two days
ago, I think, tells me that my father&#8217;s health is not satisfactory
and asks my quick return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that makes it more difficult, then, for me to
speak of what lies close to my heart, my dear sir. But
necessity knows no law and I am in the position of
a man who has no choice. Mr. Morton, I beg you to
let me say a few words to you, in the hope that you
will grant me your attention and&mdash;if possible, sympathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton nodded and, reaching for the cigars, selected
one at random and carefully lit it. &#8220;Very fine aroma
indeed, Count; I haven&#8217;t had as good a smoke as this
in many a day. Please begin; I am all attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count nodded and began: &#8220;More than twenty-five
years ago my king, then a young and little known
prince of the Coburg family, was called to the throne
of Roumelia by the vote of its people. Among the
younger men whom he asked to join him in this new
country to aid him in establishing a good government,
I was one. I was a young Army officer at the time,
with little ambition and with scarcely any diplomatic
experience. I settled down in the new country. I
was very enthusiastic, a prerogative of youth the world
over, and became very much enamored with my work.
Since then I have been very closely bound up with the
fortunes of Roumelia and those of my king. I was
one of the few of my Prince&#8217;s Court who succeeded
in gaining the confidence of the Roumelians. I acquired
their language and customs thoroughly. I succeeded
in gaining the friendship of some of the leading
men of all parties. I won the respect and I think even
the love and perhaps the admiration of the Court by
my loyalty to the cause of the country, my devotion
to my duties, my work and my fidelity to the interests
of the principality and later the kingdom, the creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and growth of which, I may be permitted to say,
may be due, in a small measure, to my efforts.</p>

<p>&#8220;My king, God bless him, one of the noblest men
who ever lived, was kind to me and trusted me implicitly.
The work to which I had devoted my life
was successfully done; the dynasty of my king firmly
established: a clean, fine constitution, safe-guarding
the interests of the people and assuring the welfare
and development of my country, strongly founded.
The one cloud in the blue sky of destiny was the lack
of a son and heir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many years ago, his majesty assenting, we secured
an amendment to our laws of succession, by which the
King&#8217;s brother was to be his heir, thus securing the
succession to a younger brother and through him to
his son, then a youth of health and promise. Thus
far our work in perpetuating a dynasty had been
wisely and well done. Do I weary you with these
particulars, Mr. Morton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all; I am more than interested; I am learning.
Please continue!&#8221; The Count smiled and went
on:</p>

<p>&#8220;This structure, which, as I explained before, was
of the utmost importance to a still broader plan, was,
in this manner, erected as we felt on a firm foundation.
Our land had developed wonderfully; from an almost
unknown Turkish province in 1866 we had created a
principality of several millions of frugal, thrifty and
moral inhabitants, engaged in fostering trade and agriculture.
We built railroads and highways, opening
the country to foreign intercourse and markets; we laid
telegraph lines connecting all corners of the land; we
also introduced and firmly established an efficient
school system. In brief, we transformed into a community
of order and civilization a previously chaotic
Turkish dependency. A dozen years after the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of our, I might almost say, my work, we fought
a glorious and victorious war against our old oppressors
and, although the jealousy and greed of the great
Powers robbed us of the full reward of our victory;
although the very nation whom we enabled to win
what, without our aid and valor, they would have lost,
deprived us of some of our territory, yet we grew in
wealth, education and well being. When my prince
was acclaimed constitutional king of the realm he had
created, I, his servant, was rewarded by being chosen
his faithful adviser and friend. Honored and trusted
for many years, I believe I helped to form and execute
those policies that I feel went far toward the establishment
of peace and happiness in our beloved kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rondell rose to his feet and strode the floor
of his cabin agitatedly. Resuming his seat after a
while, he smiled pathetically at the younger man, and
said: &#8220;Pray pardon me, Mr. Morton; my feelings get
the better of me, I am afraid. My disease seems to
have made sad inroads on me. Shall I go on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray do, Count Rondell. Don&#8217;t disturb yourself
about me. I am all ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count crossed his legs and closing his eyes
turned his face upward. His cheeks, lately flushed
and feverish, now looked drawn and gray. Reaching
for a portfolio he began automatically fingering its
lock. Then with eyes wide and in a voice husky with
emotion, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I now come to a dark chapter, my young friend.
Men work day and night, plan and scheme, bribe and
lie&mdash;all for fame and their country. The plans seem
perfect, their execution faultless, the road to certain
success assured&mdash;and then a little thing happens, a
bolt becomes loosened, some man or woman fails you
or steps unexpectedly on the scene&mdash;et voilâ!&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
perfect structure is but a house of cards&mdash;and
tumbles.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this usually comes when the architect has
passed his prime; when the resisting power of the
body has been sapped by the wearisome labor. When
this crisis comes, instead of a strong man, it finds the
statesman at a terrible disadvantage, perhaps with
mind still active and resourceful&mdash;but oh, feeble and
powerless against fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rondell spoke the last words as if in a trance.
He had evidently forgotten the existence of his companion.
He seemed to be lost in visions and dreams.</p>

<p>Morton&#8217;s cigar had gone out; he stared as if fascinated
at the noble face before him, looking so sad
and forlorn. He, too, had often wandered into the
spheres of empire building. He, too, had had his
dreams of being a leader of peoples, of opening up
those vast desert spaces of his own country to the
influences of civilization. Without knowing what
tragedy was to be unfolded to him, he looked at the
worn old aristocrat across the desk and felt that failure
and disappointment, rather than success, were
oftener the reward of great ambitions. He essayed
a mental guess at what might be further revealed to
him and awaited the rest of the tale with bated breath.</p>

<p>After a slight pause the Count relaxed his tightly
compressed, bloodless lips and went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;My king was getting old; his brother had never
been capable or active; he was just a gentleman of
leisure&mdash;and the promising boy?&mdash;I wish it were not
necessary for me to go into this chapter of our history.
The boy, a lovable, fine young man, the pride of his
parents and of his uncle the king, the idol of the country
and my hope&mdash;the boy fell in love with a heartless
and scheming adventuress. She broke his heart,
brought our finely wrought plans to naught, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
youth to his end. Four weeks ago I closed the tired
eyes of my Prince&mdash;closed them in a squalid hut in
Madras, where, after an unceasing hunt of months, I
found him. I was too late to save him for this world&mdash;I
hope I preserved his soul for the next&mdash;for
heaven!&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rondell raised his hand to his brow as if
making the sign of the cross. Absent-mindedly he
stroked his hair, while a melancholy smile came to
his lips. &#8220;May God be merciful to him!&#8221; he breathed,
a tear in his eye.</p>

<p>With deeper feeling and a vibrant voice, he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Our house of cards had fallen. My labors were
all in vain, my mission a failure and, perhaps, my life
also. You are still patient, my friend, are you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton leaned across the desk, lightly touching the
other man&#8217;s arm with an encouraging pressure. &#8220;You
did the best your wisdom dictated, Your Excellency.
Regrets are useless now. It may be there is a silver
lining to your dark cloud. Please, go on with your
tale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;thus far I have been relating to you the history
of Roumelia, the rise and fall of my chosen
fatherland. Now we reach the last chapter&mdash;the day
we are living now. Will you not light a fresh cigar,
my dear Mr. Morton? Permit me to retire for a
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Going to his sleeping room, Count Rondell filled
a goblet of water and drank feverishly. Morton lit a
cigar the while he watched the Count sinking back into
his seat.</p>

<p>The stateroom had become very close and oppressive.
No sound but the rhythmical beat of the auxiliary
engine, rather felt than heard, fell upon the ear. The
steady yellowish light on the wall threw into relief
the ghastly features of the old diplomat; the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
from Morton&#8217;s cigar hung heavily against the ceiling,
taking odd and fantastic shapes. The younger man
was strangely moved. What a terrible drama had
been laid bare! He could not take his eyes away
from the pitiful figure before him&mdash;the old nobleman
looking the very picture of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am coming now to the last chapter, Mr. Morton.
A few hours ago I received two cables informing me
of events which have happened during my absence.
The earlier cable says, in substance, in code of course,
that within the last ten days a revolt had occurred in
the capital. Rumors of the heir&#8217;s disappearance had
emboldened the disaffected factions of the kingdom,
who struck&mdash;and struck fearfully! The king had always
lived simply&mdash;and trusted his people and his
army. The few palace guards were easily overpowered;
the king was taken prisoner and with him
his consort. The ministers of state were forced to
resign, a <i>de facto</i> republican government was proclaimed,
and Demeter Sturdza, the leader of the Radicals,
an old schemer and a villain masquerading as a
patriot, has been appointed acting President. Everything
is in chaos. The later cable is still more distressing.
A trusty friend of mine, the late minister of
Finance, sends it to me from Constantinople, to which
place he has flown. He is one of the few of the old
administration who escaped.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count opened the portfolio nervously, took
some papers lying on top, and with trembling hands
adjusted his glasses. After a futile attempt to read
he resignedly put both papers and glasses down and
with a pitiful gesture resumed his narrative.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Morton&mdash;I cannot read it&mdash;I shall
have to give you the contents from memory. The
fearful facts are engraven on my mind only too deeply!
The king has been assassinated&mdash;the queen is dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
from shock. Prince Fernand was shot down in cold
blood by a drunken Colonel of the Territorials, the
ministers and counsellors are either dead, imprisoned
or fugitives. The army, at first indifferent, is now
obeying the newly formed government. The country
has been isolated from the rest of the world, as the
wires were cut. Martial law prevails and a reign of
terror instituted. The property of the old régime has
been confiscated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old diplomat had risen before he finished his
recital, staggered nervously and weakly to and fro,
and, leaning on the back of his chair, he spoke the
last words in jerky sentences.</p>

<p>&#8220;There remains the only member of the Royal family&mdash;a
lovely young girl&mdash;a mere child&mdash;the sister
of the unfortunate boy I had seen die. This innocent
princess is without friend or protector. She has
found a precarious refuge in the summer castle of
the late prince in the hills of the North. When this
cable was sent she was alive and, although deprived
of her freedom, still unharmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor girl has no knowledge of life, and is
utterly helpless. Reared in the seclusion of the court
under the care of the late queen&mdash;a most noble and
saintly lady&mdash;she is still but a child in experience.
She was my beloved king&#8217;s favorite&mdash;a beautiful, pure
girl, a noble princess. She must not perish!&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton felt dizzy and sick. His cigar had gone out
long since. He had almost ceased to think or feel.
With a great effort he pulled himself together, and
staring fixedly at his narrator, murmured thickly:
&#8220;Why&mdash;why do you tell me of all these fearful things?
What do you want from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rondell came to a stop at his desk and, laying
his hands upon the back of the chair, said quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton, I am a doomed man. The doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
tells me I have, at best, but a very little while to live&mdash;and
I feel he is right. I would not hesitate an instant
to do what is my duty&mdash;but I know I cannot. My
weak body will not obey my will. You are young,
strong and resourceful. God has led you to this boat,
led you to me in my hour of great need. Mr. Morton,
I ask you, in the name of humanity, to rescue the
girl from the fury of an insane populace&mdash;from the
nameless horror that might be her fate&mdash;I ask you,
my friend, to take my place and bring this girl safely
out of Roumelia!&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved aside Morton&#8217;s protesting gesture and
continued with deep emotion but with impressive dignity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray&mdash;my dear sir&mdash;do not answer me now. Take
it under consideration. In an hour, two hours if you
wish, let me know your decision. Do not act on the
spur of the moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton could hardly restrain himself. He felt he
could not wait. Rising nervously, he exclaimed, his
voice filled with indignation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Rondell, this is not fair! Why do you come
to me, a stranger, with so impossible, so absurd a
proposition? What right have you to unload your
burden upon a chance acquaintance and put the blame
of a possible fearful fate of a young girl at my door&mdash;my
door of all men? What do I know of kings and
princes? What do I care? Why do you come to me
with this? Much as I esteem you&mdash;much as I feel
for you in your sorrow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count drew himself up proudly and placed his
hand firmly upon Morton&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have asked myself those same questions many
times during the last two hours, when I was seeking
for a solution, looking for a ray of hope in my despair.
I came to you, sir, because I <i>must</i> do all that I can do&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
there is not a soul to whom I can appeal or who
can do what I ask, but you! I can hold out no
inducements to you. I know not if glory or money
means anything to you. Honors I cannot offer, for
I have fallen from my proud position by the very
events that have brought me pleading to you. Riches
I have none&mdash;my property has been confiscated. I
am a ruined man. I have some forty thousand francs
with me&mdash;the money is at your disposal to cover your
expenditures for the labors I am praying you to undertake.
Why do I come to you? Because you are
the last resource and the only hope left me; because I
would do anything and everything to save this girl
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton was about to interrupt, but the old man,
trembling violently, collapsed in his seat. Recovering
himself slowly he reached for the large portfolio and
opening it, slowly and almost mechanically fingered and
folded the papers within it.</p>

<p>Morton watched him, stern and wide-eyed, resolved
to remain calm and patient.</p>

<p>In a low voice, made the more impressive by its
gentleness, the Count spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive my vehemence&mdash;my insistence. I must
employ every means at hand. I have not told you
all; I have not told you the full depth of my despair.
With the Princess Marie Louise is my little daughter&mdash;my
only child. The child of my love&mdash;my pride, my
only reward in this world&mdash;the child of my beloved
wife! Here is a letter of hers, written but a few
weeks before the awful events. A letter full of love
and happiness&mdash;she did not then dream of the fearful
days that were to come! When I left Holstein to
follow my prince to a new and promising life, I had
the plighted word of a beautiful girl to join me whenever
I called her. In time my beloved came to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
We lived in a strange country, among strange people
and stranger gods; but we lived in joy and love, making
a heaven for us in this new land! When, after
some years, our child came, our lovely little girl, my
dear wife had heart and love for us both. She
brought up this child of our affection, the only child
God gave us, as only love can! Her own goodness
is reproduced in the child&mdash;her beauty of heart and
mind, her loving ways&mdash;all live again in her daughter!
Five years ago she&mdash;died, leaving our child to my
care. And now, here I am, a man with one foot in the
grave&mdash;feeble and useless&mdash;thousands of miles away
from my child&mdash;her child. My God! what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The old diplomat&#8217;s head fell upon his arms, amongst
his papers, his shoulders heaving with his inarticulate
sobbings. His hand had grasped a photograph from
among the scattered documents and he was convulsively
caressing it. Raising his head he looked at it
with an agonized look and murmured brokenly, &#8220;Mein
Kindchen&mdash;Mein Kindchen.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was more than Morton could bear. His lethargy
dropped from him; the spell was broken, his energy
returned. A second time he had been shown the
hideousness of life. He knew not what to say. Then
through his thoughts came the words of his own
father&#8217;s cable: &#8220;Am not very well, better hurry, boy!&#8221;
It was impossible for him to engage in what, after
all, was but a romantic adventure.</p>

<p>What right had this old scion of a decayed aristocracy
to appeal to him&mdash;to him, who had duties of
his own, just as urgent, to perform? What right had
anybody to tell him these hideous things, that grip
the mind and distress the heart? What was this young
woman or this princess to him that he should wait a
moment before deciding? A refusal, prompt and
emphatic&mdash;surely that was the only proper answer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
make! Was the old man acting in good faith or was
he, perhaps, staging this whole business, in order to
entangle him into a foolhardy enterprise! What
would his father say? What would mother think?
What would his little sister&mdash;ah! his little sister, a girl
like this girl! His throat felt dry and contracted,
as if a cord had been tightened about his neck.</p>

<p>Good God! And if he declined&mdash;would he ever
get rid of the awful thought that these girls might
have been helped&mdash;and he had failed them? Could he
ever look any woman in the face without thinking of
the fate of these two gently reared women? A cold
perspiration beaded his forehead and face. With an
effort he rose from his seat and strode toward the old
man, who sat now staring before him with glassy eyes.</p>

<p>All this had taken but a few moments, a few heart
beats of agony and resentment.</p>

<p>The proposition was absurd&mdash;unheard of! He had
better leave this raving lunatic alone&mdash;tell him most
emphatically that he refused. At that moment his eye
caught sight of the photograph on the desk. In the
benumbed state of his mind he unconsciously looked
and made out some writing across the lower part of
the card&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Meinem lieben Papa als Gruss. Seine Helène.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately before his agitated mind there rose
the vision of Bonn, and the old days of his &#8220;Burschenschaft.&#8221;
The happy voices and songs of his student
years came back to him and with them the poetry of
the German sentimentalist&mdash;the lovely sunshine and
the cheer of youth.</p>

<p>Mechanically taking up the photograph he looked
at it for a moment idly. The next moment he was
riveted by what he saw. What a beautiful face; what
lovely eyes; what a sweet smile! It seemed to him
as if the young girl had spoken to him, had smiled at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
him&mdash;why&mdash;this child&mdash;why&mdash;this beautiful girl must
not die&mdash;she must be saved!</p>

<p>All at once it seemed as if he heard an inner voice
calling on him to bring her into safety, into life, to
her dear father&mdash;and, above all, to himself! What
had he been thinking of a moment since? Why&mdash;nothing
could be simpler! He and Don could do the
trick all right&mdash;the girl must be saved&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>He replaced the photograph gently amongst the
papers strewn over the desk, and leaning forward,
said with hearty determination: &#8220;Count, I have thought
it over. I will do what you propose. I will go gladly
to the assistance of the young ladies. Do you understand
me, Count? We must get down to work and
plan. Do you hear what I am saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>But his host did not hear him. He had sunk deep
in his chair, his chin upon his breast, the eyes heavy
and dull, barely showing reason. Morton was shocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count&mdash;come, man, pull yourself together; say
something. I have agreed.&#8221;</p>

<p>A wan smile, like sunshine, stole over the drawn
features of the helpless man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must apologize for my rudeness,&#8221; he whispered
more than spoke. &#8220;I shall be better in a moment.&#8221;
He stretched out a trembling hand for the goblet of
water, but Morton had reached it before him, and the
old man drank the refreshing liquid thirstily.</p>

<p>The cool drink revived him. Some color returned
into the blanched cheeks and the eyes regained somewhat
of their normal lustre. He sat up more erect.
&#8220;Did I&mdash;do I understand you to say, Mr. Morton&mdash;that
you will undertake the&mdash;task? Did I understand
you correctly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency, that is exactly what I mean. I
shall undertake it&mdash;and by Jove&mdash;if it can be done,
I&#8217;ll do it! And now, lie down for an hour or so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
You must rest so that we can go ahead with our
plans. I must learn all I can about the lay of the
land&mdash;and I guess time counts more than anything
else, right now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gently pushing his host, who had tried to rise, into
the seat, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll send your man to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir, my dear boy! Permit me to call you
that for once&mdash;you have made me very happy! I
feel confident you will succeed if any man can. I
already have a plan&mdash;but you are right, I must pull
myself together first and be ready for the work.
Please, ring for my man and&mdash;in an hour I shall be at
your disposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, let&#8217;s shake hands on it. Call me anything
you please. I am proud you have chosen me. Don&#8217;t
you worry; we&#8217;ll beat the entire crazy outfit&mdash;and I
will have your girl out and in your arms in quick
order. So long, Count, rest well!&#8221; He was about
to leave when he recalled the older man&#8217;s stiff punctilious
ways. Reddening slightly he turned and, with
courtly bend, added, &#8220;Au revoir, your Excellency!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pausing upon the threshold he looked back. &#8220;Have
you a book on Roumelia with a map of the country?
I might as well get posted before I see you again.&#8221;
He laughed: &#8220;I am that way, Count; first slow and
hard to move; but once I see my way clear&mdash;why, I
get enthusiastic and forget that I am no longer a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count had the very book on the desk, map and
all. Morton took it and retired.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MORTON reached the cooler air and took several
turns around the deck. The soft breeze
playing on his face, the sight of the twinkling
lights and the bustle from the shore, awoke him to
himself. He began to realize the situation in which
he had placed himself, and to regret the enterprise
to which he had, in a sense, committed himself. It
was so different from the plans he had already formed,
so entirely at variance with his thoughts and his aims.
Was it really to be so? Or was it but a dream from
which he had just awakened? He felt like a boy
caught in a forbidden act. By Jove, the most sensible
thing would be to go back to the cabin and tell the
Count that the whole scheme was impossible! Surely
the man was not quite right in his head! What had
he to do with so absurd an adventure? Don would be
certain to think he had been talking with a lunatic if
he came to him with the story. Oh, yes, Don was the
very man to consult about this matter. He would see
him at once.</p>

<p>Then, into the kaleidoscopic whirl of his thoughts
rose again the portrait of the beautiful girl he had seen.
That was real, without a doubt. How lovely she was!
He recalled the fine outline of the oval face, the
thoughtful brow, the slightly parted lips with their
faint curve of a smile. He wondered what color her
hair and eyes were. And then he saw the slender
throat, the simple, graceful pose of the child-woman.
She surely must have a mind as beautiful as her face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
He could almost see the little mouth pout, and the
beautiful blue eyes (yes, they were blue) fill with tears.</p>

<p>He swore silently under his breath and lit his pipe.
He could think better smoking. A few puffs and he
had made up his mind. He was in for it, right or
wrong&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t back out. He was
wasting time, even now. He must be up and doing.
Don must be told at once. He wouldn&#8217;t tell him more
than a bare outline&mdash;simply announce the change in
his program and order him to prepare for a journey&mdash;the
Count would have some plan worked out.</p>

<p>As to his people&mdash;his father? Oh, well, he had
already intimated that he might go to Turkestan.
The governor was all right and two or three weeks
more wouldn&#8217;t make an absence of two years seem
much longer. He would get ready.</p>

<p>On the main deck in a cozy spot he found Don,
surrounded by youngsters of all ages and both sexes,
telling the little ones some fairy tale. It was remarkable
how fond Donald was of children and how quickly
the children took to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Don, to disturb this little party.
Would you mind coming to my cabin&mdash;I have an important
matter to talk over with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Don felt surprise he succeeded in hiding it.
Smilingly depositing a mite of a girl from his knee on
to the deck, he disentangled himself from the swarm
about him, and said quickly: &#8220;All right, Mr. Morton,
I&#8217;ll be down in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Promising the children to resume his tale next morning,
and accompanied by shrill calls of: &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget,
Mr. McCormick,&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell anything when
I aren&#8217;t here,&#8221; he followed Morton.</p>

<p>Arrived in his cabin, Morton silently motioned his
man to a seat and sat down himself. He at once informed
Don that important matters about which for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the present he could say nothing, obliged him to
change the original plan of travel. The journey to
Italy would have to be interrupted by a couple of
weeks&#8217; stay in Eastern Europe. An important undertaking
had to be accomplished that needed cool judgment
and careful preparation. Don must leave by the
midnight train and embark the next evening on the
Lloyd boat for Brindisi. Further orders would be
ready for him when he arrived there. Donald simply
nodded and made ready to rise when Morton suddenly
changed his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don, we have serious work laid out for us&mdash;I am
not ready to tell you what&mdash;I don&#8217;t quite know myself
what it is&mdash;but you will have to be over there at once
and start at the business. I&#8217;ll have our agent from
Rome meet you in Brindisi and he will act on your
instructions. I&#8217;ll cable him and have letters of introduction
ready. Now let&#8217;s put down what we need.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was to secure a large amount of money in
gold and bills current in Balkan countries; especially
gold&mdash;for Roumelia.</p>

<p>He was to obtain all the information available about
Roumelia, collect newspaper articles on Roumelian
affairs beginning with October fifteenth, tabulate them
so that they could go over them quickly, and get information
about the best train connections with
Bucharest. Morton would need the help of an American
Consul. Don must induce the Consul at Rome or
Naples to come to Brindisi to meet him, Morton.
Morton would explain things later. Passports good
for all the Balkan states, and especially Roumelia,
would be needed. Also introductory letters to American
Consuls and to such men of standing as the
consul or the agents of the firm could influence.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;s face had, during this recital, been assuming a
more and more puzzled expression. &#8220;Is it all on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
level, Mr. John?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It sounds kind o&#8217;
crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>John grunted: &#8220;It&#8217;s all right enough; just wait until
you know why.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was further instructed to obtain a full equipment
for three men&mdash;four rifles, revolvers and ammunition&mdash;all
of the best make. A camp outfit for five
or six people, rugs, furs, tools, canned meats and provender
for horses for ten days.</p>

<p>Don looked so astonished that Morton couldn&#8217;t suppress
a grin. He decided to take his man further into
his confidence, and impressed him with the need of
discretion.</p>

<p>Once Don had the outline of the &#8220;job&#8221; clearly in
his mind, he looked relieved. Morton knew now that
all his instructions would be obeyed to the letter, and
that he was certain of a faithful adherent. Don&#8217;s interest
took on an enthusiasm which showed that he
was eager for the adventure. The primitive man in
him had begun to assert itself. He would do and dare
anything.</p>

<p>When everything had been agreed upon and settled
to their satisfaction, Morton dismissed his man and returned
to the Count in his cabin. He found the old
man feeling much better&mdash;the eyes were brighter and
the tone of his voice stronger. He was glad that
Morton had come because he was anxious to lay out
the plans of action.</p>

<p>He informed Morton that he had cabled to his friend
in Constantinople asking further information and expected
a reply the next morning. When he was told
that Donald was going to Brindisi ahead of them, he
was pleased&mdash;that would gain time, he thought.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton was to go to Kronstadt in Transylvania,
only a short distance from the Roumelian border
and equip there. A good priest of that town, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
faithful and well-informed man, would be of great
help to him. His good will was assured&mdash;he was
under obligation to the Count and could be relied on.
With native guides and helpers obtained there&mdash;men
that knew the country and language&mdash;Mr. Morton
could assume the dress of an ordinary citizen and give
out some purpose of travel not likely to awaken suspicion.
The guides would drive into Padina as farmers
bringing their produce to the town market.</p>

<p>At Padina&mdash;there was one man there, a Jewish
merchant who was very loyal to the Count and his
family, a very shrewd and resourceful man who, in
all likelihood, would be standing well with the new
powers. The man was absolutely true and loyal and
would be of great assistance.</p>

<p>These matters clearly understood the Count suggested
that perhaps an outline of the history of Roumelia
during the past quarter century would help Mr.
Morton to understand the situation. Morton expressed
himself as eager to be enlightened.</p>

<p>No one could be with Count Rondell without succumbing
to the charm of his magnetic personality.
He told his tale with the skill of an accomplished
<i>raconteur</i> and with the knowledge of personal experience.
The man who was speaking had played a great
part in the drama he unfolded. It was a rare pleasure
that Morton enjoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, my dear Mr. Morton,&#8221; said the Count
when he had finished, &#8220;that as a republican you
may not be in sympathy with monarchy, but if you
will permit me to explain it may help to straighten
out any false ideas you may have&mdash;at least, so far as
my own country is concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means, Count,&#8221; replied Morton heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not attempt to discuss which is or which is
not the most proper and most enlightened form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
government&mdash;that would be futile now&mdash;we certainly
agree that some form of government is absolutely
needed to secure the peaceful development of any commonwealth.
You Americans, with a virile and highly
gifted population descended from peoples who have
lived under liberal laws for many generations, inhabiting
a virtually virgin land of great resources,
without a history of oppression to live down&mdash;you are
capable of existing and prospering under a democracy.
Believe me, my dear sir, Roumelia never could and
never will survive under a similar form of government.
The novelty may appeal to them, the delusion
of a new kind of freedom may delude them, but the
people are not educated for it, they are not ready for
it. They need the pomp of a court, the strong personality
of an acknowledged ruler to temper demagogue
ambitions and to curb the desire of the common
mind to become enriched at the expense of the country.
There must be some one who is above bribery, who
will not be swayed by selfish motives but who has
the public welfare at heart&mdash;such a man can only be
the king. His position is God&#8217;s gift; and he is responsible
to his Maker alone! A republican form of
government in the Balkans! My dear sir, it would
be a farce, were it not a tragedy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton made no reply, and Count Rondell crossed
his legs and leaned further back in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Morton,&#8221; he said, with a plaintive
smile, &#8220;may I speak my mind to you? I cannot explain
it, but I was drawn to you from the first. You are
a man whose kind I have always loved and admired&mdash;perhaps
it is because we do not raise the like in my
own country. I wish I had a son like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count, I am proud of your esteem and regard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy!&#8221; and impulsively the Count pressed
Morton&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I am very, very happy and feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
certain you will succeed. Save my beloved daughter
and the noble Princess&mdash;and, perhaps, save also Roumelia
from herself and her abominations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At present, Count Rondell, it will be well if I
think less of politics or kings and more of the two
ladies who will need all our help. If one of them regains
her right&mdash;well and good.&#8221; The old man puffed
at his cigar thoughtfully. &#8220;You are right,&#8221; he said
at last.</p>

<p>The two men sat in converse until a late hour. Morton
smoking incessantly, was satisfied to sit and listen to
this remarkable old man, who in spite of his delicate
frame possessed a will of iron, a mind as keen and as
brilliant as a diamond and a heart as noble and tender
as a woman&#8217;s. The Count had told him of his search
for the weakling of a prince and its tragic end. Morton
marvelled at the devotion and nerve of this faithful
servant of the Crown. &#8220;What a man!&#8221; he said to
himself. &#8220;What a splendid example for any highly
resolved youth to emulate!&#8221; Surely he would do well
to be moved by a like spirit! &#8220;Nihil sine Deo,&#8221; was
Roumelia&#8217;s motto, the Count had told him. Henceforth
his motto would be &#8220;Omnia cum Deo.&#8221; His
heart expanded in sympathy for the long-suffering
statesman&mdash;he would be worthy of the trust imposed
in him and would succeed.</p>

<p>Again the likeness of the beautiful girl came before
him. An overwhelming desire to see the photograph
once more seized him. With the instinctive cunning
of a lover, he remarked: &#8220;Bye-the-bye, Count,
you will, of course, furnish me with proper credentials.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. The letters I shall have ready for you
are carefully listed on the memorandum I have prepared
for you. I shall also ask you to take this ring.
It will vouch for you with all my friends and followers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
When showing it say the words, &#8216;Arnim&#8217;s pledge.&#8217;
And I must also give you the photographs of the
young ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rondell, to Morton&#8217;s delight, reached for
the portfolio and opened its quaint and curious lock.</p>

<p>&#8220;This I think is the best likeness of the three I
have with me,&#8221; and he handed over the very photograph
Morton had first seen. &#8220;I shall have a copy
of it made early to-morrow and will include it with
the other papers.&#8221; Morton had seized the portrait and
was devouring it with his eyes. &#8220;She is a beautiful
girl, Mr. Morton!&#8221;</p>

<p>John turned his face away so that the Count should
not notice his expression, and remarked politely but
with an air of nonchalance: &#8220;Yes, Count, she is very
bright and attractive. It is a little difficult for a
stranger to see a likeness&mdash;does she favor you in any
way?&#8221; In his heart he felt it was the most adorable,
the most beautiful face he had ever seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;She may, a little; but to me she has always seemed
like her sainted mother. Although a child in appearance,
she is past nineteen and quite tall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton thought nineteen was young enough. He
longed to keep the photograph. He felt he could look
at it for ever. Reluctantly he handed it back.</p>

<p>The hour was late and Morton regretted he had
kept the sick man from his bed. Rising quickly he
excused himself and, promising to look in early the
next morning, he retired to his own cabin. There
he learned that Donald had completed his packing,
and was ready for the journey.</p>

<p>He at once sat down and wrote a letter to his
father&#8217;s agents at Brindisi introducing Don and giving
him full power to act in his stead, and requesting
them to aid his representative in every way they could.
Don was to be given such funds as he needed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
instructions to this effect would come from headquarters
by cable.</p>

<p>To his father he cabled: &#8220;Will leave England second
week November. Will advise steamer. Take care
yourself, love all. Please approve by cable heavy
drafts on your agents Rome, Brindisi. Am well.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his mother: &#8220;Cable Hindoostan Port Said and
later Brindisi father&#8217;s health. Can I stay in Europe
two weeks longer? Love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having despatched the cables he settled down to
write his letters&mdash;one each to his father and mother.
The cable he had received disturbed him. He was
anxious about his father&#8217;s health.</p>

<p>The letters, indicative of John&#8217;s character and his
relations to his parents are, perhaps, worthy of reproduction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Suez</span>, October &mdash;&mdash;, 189&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>:</p>

<p>At last I am out of the desert and once more within civilization
on my way home. I cabled you to-night:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will leave England second week November. Will advise
steamer. Take care yourself, love all. Please approve
by cable heavy drafts on your agents, Rome, Brindisi. Am
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shall have to go to Paris for some days, see some friends
in Germany and report in London to the Secretary of the
Colonies about my work in Egypt; expect to take the Cunarder
that leaves November 14th from Liverpool.</p>

<p>Have had your letters of August 10th and September 16th
upon arriving here, and some letters from mother and sis.
Also have your cable of the &mdash;&mdash; in which you ask me to
come home as you are not feeling well.</p>

<p>I hope, dear father, this does not mean that you are ill.
You work too hard and play too little. When I get back
I&#8217;ll want you to make use of me, put me into harness and
ease up on yourself. I have had any amount of time in
the desert to think of my work and my duty, and I assure
you, father, I will settle down and try to carry on your work
and your plans. I have always admitted that you knew best
and were ever right. I repeat that now and want to put
myself at your service.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>I am hearty and strong. You will find me fit and willing,
and the life abroad and the knowledge I have gained have
done me good, I think. How I do look forward, dear Dad,
to seeing you again; to sit by you and chat and plan! How
proud I am that my work here has been so successful! Dad,
you will be pleased. Your ideas are absolutely borne out,
and with the data we have of Jackson&#8217;s Hole country I am
positive the work can be done and finished in two and a
half or three years. We can rely on at least 300 million
gallons of storage reserve and a useful supply of not less
than 18 million per day. Isn&#8217;t that glorious?</p>

<p>Remember, father, you always hinted that my duty, as the
last of the Mortons, was to settle down, marry and see to
it that I shan&#8217;t remain the last of your doughty clan. Well,
I am as &#8220;dour&#8221; as any Morton ever was&mdash;and willing. As
I am writing in similar strain to mother I expect between
you two you will try and pick the mother of my future offspring.
I guess you will want her to be fair and mother
dark&mdash;I will thus, at least, have a chance of choosing for
myself!</p>

<p>But, joking aside, Dad, I am ready to quit roving for
good, ready to give up adventure, ready to settle down in
the dear old home and go into business. And if I can&#8217;t
duplicate you, father, I&#8217;ll make a good try anyway!</p>

<p>Have you gotten the Mummy which I shipped in May;
and did the Sarcophagus reach you that I sent by &#8220;underground&#8221;
in July? The latter is certainly a very fine specimen
and will just fit into your gallery.</p>

<p>I feel fine. I am, if anything, heavier than two years ago,
and didn&#8217;t have a sick minute while in Africa. I am
browned as dark as the headwaiter at the Lake House and
with a little practice could beat you on the links.</p>

<p>Unless I have cable from you will stick to the above plan
and be in New York on November 22d.</p>

<p>Donald is well and glad to turn his nose west. He asks
to be remembered to you. You will be satisfied with him
when you look at me.</p>

<p>Dearest love to you all, my loved ones.</p>

<p>Give my regards to all our friends whom I shall be glad
to see again this winter.</p>

<p>I embrace you, my dear Dad.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">Your loving</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;&#8220;Am going to draw rather heavily on your agents
in Rome or Brindisi, as I won&#8217;t have time to see bankers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
before getting to London. Will settle by transfer from my
account when I return.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The other letter to his mother, he wrote more carefully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Suez</span>, October&mdash;&mdash;, 189&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Mother</span>:</p>

<p>By this same mail I am writing to father and you will
get all information about me from that letter. You are not
supposed to show this, your own letter, to Dad; it is partly
for you only, as you will see in the next few sentences.</p>

<p>I have cabled to you inquiring if father&#8217;s health is in any
way alarming and expect your reply promptly. If the answer
is favorable I shall take a week or so in Europe for
an enterprise which looks very important to me and of which
you, I am certain, would approve.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t even time to write a long letter, but as I shall
be but a week or two later than these lines, my tale can
well wait.</p>

<p>This enterprise, dear mater, I cannot specify more exactly
than to say that I know you would applaud the principle
involved and would yourself urge me to undertake it.</p>

<p>I can hardly wait until I am home with you, dearest
mother, and with father and Ruth. I shall have an awful
lot to tell, of strange countries, experiences and a study of
life that has been granted to few men. You may lionize
me, mother, and ask all the swell people of the ultra cultured
crowd to come and listen to your son&#8217;s adventures. I
shall let my hair grow, raise again the beautiful whiskers
that were four days ago sacrificed on the altar of comfort
and decency (tell Ruth I have preserved a photo with them
on) and satisfy the craving of society for something novel.</p>

<p>Mater, dear, you always claimed I was a good deal &#8220;Randolph&#8221;
in my exterior; did the R&#8217;s ever run into red hair?
My whiskers&mdash;save the mark&mdash;were of a hue which an enemy
of your proud Virginia ancestry might designate as&mdash;red!
Please don&#8217;t mention it to Ruth; the photo doesn&#8217;t show the
color and she might be shocked.</p>

<p>Now, Mother dear, be happy and be sure to be just as
pretty as you always were. I think the natural bird will be
ready to be substituted for the fatted calf by the time I get
home, because&mdash;Thanksgiving will put me at your table and&mdash;Oh,
won&#8217;t the turkey taste good!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Love to Ruthie and thousands of kisses to you both, dearest
mother.</p>

<p class="right">Ever Your Loving Admirer and Son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apropos! If Ruth really pesters you as she surely will
and starts a guessing match&mdash;tell her the lady is five foot
eleven, hair raven and eyes&mdash;a deep violet bordering on
purplish black&mdash;she&#8217;s proud and has refused me three times.
I am going to follow her into her retreat, play the guitar
outside her little window for ten consecutive nights, moonlight
or no light. If she melts under the influence of the
sweet strains, my pleadings and the proofs of dad&#8217;s wealth&mdash;I
shall bring her home dragging her along by a chain of
Marshal Niel roses; if she remains cold and disdainful&mdash;she,
I mean Ruth, can pick the girl for me in old America.
But mind you&mdash;only one at a time, please, for safety&#8217;s sake.
You must remember I have dwelt in the Orient for two
years, and the Orient&mdash;you recall the hundred wives of Solomon?
So don&#8217;t subject me to the charms of more than one
divine lady at a time. Love to all&mdash;I mean you of course
and not the prospective ladies!&mdash;<span class="smcap">John.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The writing and sending of the cables and letters
quieted John&#8217;s mind; he had acquitted himself of his
filial duties for the time being at least. With renewed
zest he again entered into his plans for the enterprise
before him&mdash;and it was not until a very late hour that
he found his bed.</p>

<p>The steamer reached Ishmaila and Port Said in
good time. Here he received his one cable answer
from his father informing him that the delay would
not matter in the least and wishing him good luck and
an early termination of the new work. Agents in
Rome and Brindisi had been notified to honor his
drafts.</p>

<p>Early next morning the Mediterranean was entered
and the last stretch of the voyage begun.</p>

<p>Count Rondell had become feebler and appeared
less frequently and for shorter periods on deck or in
the smoking room. His features had become duller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and John caught Dr. Brown more than once looking
anxiously at his new friend. The Count never complained,
rarely referred to his health at all and, when
with John, would speak only of his country and his
early life. Each interview served but to knit him
and John more closely together.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when Morton, as usual, was visiting
the count in his stateroom, he found the old man
strangely silent and seemingly very depressed. John
tried to draw him into conversation, asking questions
about his beloved Roumelia, but the Count replied
only in monosyllables. He seemed curiously embarrassed.
Finally, however, the old man roused himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Morton&mdash;I feel ashamed and humiliated&mdash;I
am at a loss how to apologize to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>John looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning,&#8221; continued the Count, &#8220;I was visited
by some kind-hearted gentlemen who were so courteous
as to wish to entertain me in my forced seclusion. I
learned from them, for the first time, who you really
are. I am distressed to think that I had offered you
money as the price of your services. I knew, of course,
of a Mr. Morton, one of the financial bulwarks of the
Western world, but I never thought of connecting
you with him. I humbly beg your forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Count, pray, don&#8217;t distress yourself on
that account. We can devote the money to the expenses
of the undertaking itself if it is needed. Let
us not refer to it again, Your Excellency.&#8221; John spoke
heartily and with emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good. You absolve me, Mr. Morton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am greatly relieved. Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time they had arrived at the Italian littoral
Morton was well posted on Roumelia and also completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in love with his tutor&#8217;s daughter. It gave him
a curious pleasure to hear the father talk about his
child. The Count never, for a moment, suspected that
John was skillfully guiding the conversation to that
subject, for he himself was an enthusiast on it. John,
on the other hand, did not realize that he was playing
with fire but sat opposite the old man and kept saying
to himself, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what I am thinking, old
chap! I wonder what you&#8217;d say, if you did know?
I am ready to fall in love with your daughter, head
over heels! Just you wait&mdash; I hope you&#8217;ll like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count&#8217;s valet had made a very excellent print
of the photograph selected and this copy was now
safely stowed away in Morton&#8217;s breast pocket. It
remained there until he reached the privacy of his
stateroom, and then he placed it in the palm of his
hand and gave free vent to his excited imagination.</p>

<p>She did have beautiful eyes, this &#8220;little Helène!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">PAST Santa Andrea, the Forte a Mare of the
harbor of Brindisi, the steamer crept slowly
through the narrow channel connecting the
outer bay with the splendid and well-protected inner
waterway, and drew up alongside the fine stone Molo
di San Giovanni across the heart of the town.</p>

<p>Morton, standing on deck aloof from his fellow
passengers, extended his silent greetings to Europe.
His heart beat with gladness and expectation. The
last days had seemed never-ending, so eager was he
to begin the adventure on which he had now set his
heart. He had made his adieus to the ship&#8217;s company
and passengers. Friendships easily and quickly
formed on board a ship are, as a rule, built on the
slender foundation of the ennui of the moment; the
boon companions of the smoking room soon become
merely pictures for the memory to paint in, after days;
even the charming lady whose deck chair adjoins yours
fades into the hazy past&mdash;&#8220;Out of sight, out of mind!&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton&#8217;s first care on landing, after meeting his
agent from Rome who had come to the ship, was to
see that Count Rondell had been safely and comfortably
housed in a hotel. The old man was very feeble
and it was with difficulty that he was removed from
the ship. The ship&#8217;s doctor had seen to it that a good
physician was in attendance to give him all the necessary
attention and care. This done to Morton&#8217;s
satisfaction, he promised the Count to return in a short
time and went himself to a nearby <i>osteria</i> for any
cables or letters which might have arrived for him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
learned that all his orders and instructions had been
properly carried out and, what was more pleasing,
that none of the cables or letters awaiting him called
for any alterations in the plans he had made with
Count Rondell.</p>

<p>Learning that a fast train left Brindisi for the North
in a couple of hours, he gave Donald his final instructions
and the letters he had prepared for him and saw
him off for Kronstadt, promising to meet him there
the day after his arrival.</p>

<p>With his agent Morton then went to the hotel and
met the American Consul who had come from Naples
to offer his services. The Consul turned out to be a
pleasant and bright young man who was fairly well
acquainted with the Balkan countries. He provided
Morton with passports and letters of introduction to
American Consuls in the section which he expected
to visit. He suggested that Morton should travel
under his own name as an American capitalist interested
in oil lands and as being also interested in purchasing
some of the highly bred horses for which
Roumelia was noted. The rest must be left to
Morton&#8217;s own quick wit, he said, and the length of
his purse&mdash;especially the latter. The political state
of the country was not quiet; but he thought
that Morton, as an American trader, should meet with
few or no difficulties. The people of the Balkans were
tradesmen and loved to meet anyone by whom they
could profit. With this parting advice he left.</p>

<p>Returning to the Count&#8217;s hotel, Morton found him
in bed, weak but cheerful, with his valet and a newly
engaged nurse in attendance. Dr. Brown, who was
in the adjoining apartment, had telephoned for a
prominent specialist from Rome who was expected to
arrive within a few hours.</p>

<p>Morton took a chair, and begging the nurse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
leave him alone with her invalid, sat down by the
Count&#8217;s bedside. He told him in detail of what he
had done since leaving the ship. The information
cheered the sick man and brought a brighter look into
his tired eyes. He pressed the young man&#8217;s hand
gratefully. &#8220;I trust you implicitly, dear friend,&#8221; he
murmured.</p>

<p>Morton smiled and promised that he would wire
and write whenever he could do so without endangering
the attainment of his ultimate object. He begged
him to be of good cheer and to be patient&mdash;all would
end well. His father&#8217;s agent had instructions to be
at the Count&#8217;s service. Mr. Kelly, Morton&#8217;s agent,
would call on him from time to time, and he begged
Count Rondell to make liberal use of his time.</p>

<p>The old man could not speak, so overcome was he
with emotion; but he pressed Morton&#8217;s hands and
looked the gratitude he felt.</p>

<p>The hour had now approached when Morton must
leave. The doctor also had come in and whispered
that the patient was being overtaxed. Morton therefore
rose:</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Rondell, my dear friend, I know what is in
your mind. Let me assure you, that come what may,
I shall do my best to look after your daughter. If you
should not be here to protect her&mdash;I will. If she does
not find a suitable home at the court,&mdash;I shall bring
her to my mother, who will be her friend. Have no
anxiety, dear friend. Think only of yourself&mdash;think
only of getting well again. But, again, whatever happens
she will never want a friend so long as I live.&#8221;
He reached for the sick man&#8217;s hand and as a final
word, said earnestly, &#8220;I will succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Rondell&#8217;s eyes had been closed while Morton
was speaking. He now opened them wide, and a wan,
happy smile irradiated his face. He pressed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
feverish clasp the hand held out to him and whispered
rather than spoke: &#8220;May God reward you, my son.
If I get well&mdash;I shall be your debtor for life; if I die
before your return&mdash;I shall die happy. May God bless
you, my boy&mdash;Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Au revoir, Count&mdash;be of good courage and get
well!&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton withdrew hastily, afraid to trust himself
any longer because of the stress of his emotions, and
glad to relieve his mind in discussing the final arrangements
for the Count&#8217;s care with Dr. Brown. To his
agent, who was also waiting in the hotel, he entrusted
the moneys the Count had given him with the request
that they be deposited at the local branch of the &#8220;Banca
Nationale&#8221; in the name and to the order of the Count.
He was to draw on Morton&#8217;s funds for all that was
needed for the Count&#8217;s comfort and to stop at no expense,
if necessary.</p>

<p>Leaving the hotel, he threaded his way through the
narrow and crowded streets and arrived at the railway
station, very tired and hungry. A nearby <i>osteria</i> invited
him with its cheerful aspect. In the sunny back-room
the brown-faced comely hostess served him a
bountiful meal of which he ate heartily. When he had
finished, he looked at his watch and found he had still
plenty of time. He thought of the cables he had
received and took them from his pocket. &#8220;Father
rather unwell but not serious according Brooks. Delay
permissible. All well and send love, Mother.&#8221; His
father had cabled more laconically: &#8220;Go ahead.
Christmas will do. Agency has orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rang the bell and asked for pen, ink and paper.
The smiling landlady bowed and returned with a green
and orange striped penholder and a tiny bottle partly
filled with a pale bluish fluid. What should he write?
He leaned over the table and played with the penholder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
idly, sipping occasionally the chianti from a many-colored
glass goblet. The slanting rays of the October
sun lighted up the plainly furnished room with its
whitewashed walls on which hung a chromo of a rosy-cheeked
Madonna and child, and a dark crucifix. The
wax flowers on the mantelpiece attracted a bee which
buzzed noisily against the bell-shaped glass covering.
Occasionally Morton would look up and glance through
the open window through which he dreamily noticed
the little brick-paved garden, deeply shaded by the
high wall and the buildings enclosing it. A few brilliantly
colored dahlias, some clumps of chrysanthemums,
and a few tomato plants despoiled of their
crimson glory waved gently in the wind. A solitary
starling skipped in and out from between the beds
furtively glancing about with bright eyes and seemingly
quite unenthusiastic over the place in which he
found himself. Even in sunny Italy, the autumnal
season has its sad forebodings.</p>

<p>Morton felt he owed his mother some reason for
the change he had made in his original plans. She
would certainly expect an explanation. What should
he say without betraying the confidence imposed in
him by Count Rondell? And yet he longed to tell her
of what was really impelling him. Should he send her
the photograph? And if he did what could he say?
No&mdash;he must say nothing about the girl. He must
write generalities,&mdash;perhaps drop a hint or so, and
let it go at that.</p>

<p>The monotonous regular ticking of the clock in the
adjoining public room reminded him forcibly that
time was passing and that the train would not wait.
Dipping the pen into the bottle, he began and wrote
rapidly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Brindisi</span>, October &mdash;&mdash;, 189&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Mother</span>:</p>

<p>Since leaving Port Said I have had time to reflect on my
lengthened stay here, of which I advised you by cable from
Suez.</p>

<p>In Port Said I received your reply saying that father&#8217;s
illness was not serious and my further stay in Europe permissible.
Also that you and Sis were well. Here in Brindisi
I received further confirmation by cable from you and
father.</p>

<p>Of course I am very happy that dear father&#8217;s ailment (I
can&#8217;t imagine what it can be) is not serious and fervently
hope that you will be getting him into fine shape soon. I
hope by the time I get home, he will be his old self again.
I am equally glad that you and Ruth are well and happy.</p>

<p>As to myself&mdash;physically I am disgracefully fine, mentally
I have nothing to worry me. I am more than anxious to
get home, to embrace you and kiss you, and tell you of my
work, my adventures, and what I have learned and done. I
want to settle down, do anything you want me to do, mater
dear, either in business, in society or even as a husband!
Yes, dear mother, I am willing to do what you always hinted
I should do&mdash;take unto myself a wife, emulate father&#8217;s example
and be a good American business man and&mdash;a &#8220;paterfamilias.&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t intend to write all this, but since the cat is out o&#8217;
the bag, I may as well confess it. I can imagine you now
going over the list of eligible girls; for of course there isn&#8217;t
a girl living who would not jump at the chance of marrying
your boy, your handsome John&mdash;all we have to do is to pick
the best!</p>

<p>Seriously, mother, I feel it is time for me to cease wandering
and to look for happiness and satisfaction in a home.
It is time for me to be a true Morton (tempered, of course,
with the blue blood of the Randolphs) and try my best to
carry out father&#8217;s wishes and work with him.</p>

<p>I have seen and learned a great deal, but all that I have
learned only confirms me in my conviction that all work is
ennobling, that all true labor is equally honorable to a man.
And I will do all I can to make you proud of me. I am
going to show you a trick or two! So you&#8217;d better sit up
and take notice!</p>

<p>To come back to the subject of girls&mdash;don&#8217;t smile, mater&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
have gotten a glimpse of a girl I want to know better. If
she is what I believe her to be, I shall try to win her. If
all goes well, and <i>my</i> ideal is realized&mdash;I am sure, dearest
mother, you will love her. I do not think I can lose my
heart to one not worthy of your regard, and I am too much
your son not to have my judgment swayed by feelings and
sentiments like yours.</p>

<p>My taste has never been impugned&mdash;I must take after
father, who certainly had an eye for beauty if his choice of
a wife is to be anything to go by. This, between you and
me, dearest mother, is a confession.</p>

<p>Just think of it, in a few hours I shall have shaken the dust
of Italy (and with it the nasty little fleas that accompany
it); in two weeks both Africa and Europe will have become
a memory, and I shall be on the water sailing for my beloved
home, eager to breathe the free air of America, greet the
star spangled glory of our own land and be with you my
dears&mdash;for better and for worse&mdash;for worse for you, eh?</p>

<p>Tell Ruth to be good, not to eat too much turkey or pudding
on Thanksgiving and keep up her French. I shall
bring her some new books and, perhaps, a poodle to talk to.
And give her my love&mdash;and for goodness sake don&#8217;t tell her
about the nonsense I have written on the previous page.</p>

<p>To father give my dearest love and best wishes. If his
work and health permit we might, after New Year, run
down to the Everglades while you and Sis stay in St. Augustine,
and get some sport.</p>

<p>You, dearest mother, I embrace many, many times.</p>

<p>I kiss and greet you all, my dears,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">Your loving son,</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The letter sealed and addressed, John gathered up
his belongings, paid his modest reckoning to the buxom
lady of the <i>osteria</i> and walked briskly to the station,
whence now shone the first lights of the evening
against the yellowish sky.</p>

<p>Dr. Brown and Mr. Kelly were both there to see
him off. Soon the song of the wheels kept time to his
thoughts as the train sped on its way to the North&mdash;to
the new land of his adventure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>It was a relief to be once again entirely alone, alone
with his thoughts and his romance. His hand stole to
the inner pocket of his coat. From among the papers
he carefully selected the photograph and held it at
arm&#8217;s length, contemplating it with happy anticipation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems like a fool&#8217;s errand, but, by Jove, you are
a beautiful girl! May success attend me&mdash;and may I
bring you back with me, to my people&mdash;my sweetheart&mdash;my
wife!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">SPARKLING sunshine and a clear blue sky reminding
him poignantly of the glory of the
Indian Summer of his own land, greeted Morton
upon his arrival at the neat and attractive terminal
of Kronstadt&mdash;his present goal and the town
that was to be his Rubicon. Kronstadt once behind
him, and he on his way south, his adventure would
have begun. He thought of Khartoum, recalling an
earlier experience when this furthest bulwark of civilization
had been his last outfitting station before
going into the unknown regions of Africa, and experienced
a similar sensation now that he had felt
then&mdash; Was it a good omen?</p>

<p>The questions and doubts which had beset him so
frequently during the tedious and solitary railway
journey across Italy, Austria and Hungary again
assailed him. He tried to put them out of his mind.
There would be no turning back for him. The prudent
caution of the Mortons died hard, but the Randolphs
won out in the end. Of course, he was a fool,
but it was good to be a fool among so many wise ones
of the earth&mdash;good to be this kind of a fool.</p>

<p>Deeply occupied as he was with these and other
thoughts&mdash;thoughts of the instructions Count Rondell
had given him&mdash;he was yet sufficiently diverted by the
glorious day, the novel and stimulating sights, to
enjoy the short ride from the station to the St. Aloysius
Rectory. He admired the well-paved beautiful
avenue leading from the railway station to the town
nestling among the green and brown hills, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
stood out clearly against the ultramarine background
of bold mountains.</p>

<p>Equally attractive was the town itself with its quaint
and quiet square, its clean gravel walks and the groups
of religious statuary guarded by massive chains hanging
from moss-covered stone pillars.</p>

<p>The red-faced cabby, who looked like a character
in a musical comedy, stopped his vehicle before a narrow,
red brick building somewhat retired from the
square, flanked by the gray walls of a nondescript
church. He pointed with his whip-handle to the small
stone-faced door above which was a tarnished cross
and grunted something that John could not for the
life of him make out. Above the door, in a circular
panel, he made out the words, &#8220;St. Aloysius.&#8221; This
was the place, no doubt. Dismissing the cabby, he
walked up to the door and gave a vigorous pull at the
bell-handle. After waiting a few minutes, he heard
steps along the corridor within and the grating in the
door slowly opened revealing the wizened features of
an old woman who peered inquiringly out at him. He
spoke to her in German and inquired after Herr
Reverend Moskar. The little woman, after a prolonged
and careful examination of Morton, evidently
found him satisfactory, for she opened the door and
begged him to enter.</p>

<p>He was ushered into a darkened sitting room and
had scarcely time to look around him, when a door
communicating mysteriously with the interior of the
house was opened and there entered a heavily built,
stout man in cassock and mitred cap. The features
were grave and imposing; but when Morton gave his
name, he was pleased to notice the face relax and glad
to grasp the fleshy palm extended to him in welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are most welcome, Herr Morton, as any friend
of the noble Count Arnim is. I have already seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
your servant, Mr. McCormick, and received the letter
you sent by him.&#8221; Had the gracious gentleman, however,
brought any letters from his noble patron the
Count, the priest humbly asked.</p>

<p>John handed him a letter from Rondell and showed
the ring. Immediately the priest&#8217;s attitude took on
an even more friendly and courteous manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are not too tired after your lengthy journey,
perhaps you will come upstairs where we can be more
comfortable and private.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton bowed. The priest led the way back to the
foyer and whispered a few words to the old woman
who was standing near the door with her withered
hands complacently folded. She retired at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; remarked the priest as they were
ascending the creaking stairs, &#8220;but our people are inquisitive
and somewhat given to gossip.&#8221; John smiled
his understanding.</p>

<p>Morton was then ushered into a well-lighted room,
the sombre walls of which were lined with well-filled
book-cases, above which hung a number of paintings
of religious subjects. When they were comfortably
seated, Father Moskar begged his visitor to speak as
frankly as he wished of all that he desired him to
know.</p>

<p>From a little closet he brought out a couple of goblets,
a bottle of golden wine and filled the two glasses.
On the table was a box of cigars which he pushed over
to his guest. The ice thus broken, Morton entered on
his subject while the old priest listened most attentively,
taking in every word said to him. When Morton
had concluded, the old man said quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Morton&mdash;I will do everything in my power&mdash;but
do not tell me your plans. It will be better if I
am not in your confidence. Count Arnim has told
you that you could rely on me. I am honored; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
it will be wiser if I act according to your instructions
without being acquainted with your reasons. As I
understand, your man, Herr McCormick, is now at
the wagoner&#8217;s, who is one of my flock. He will be
well served there. I am expecting, at any moment,
the arrival of another member of my congregation&mdash;a
certain Papiu Ilarian, who knows well both the
mountains of our land and those south of the divide.
He speaks German, Roumelian and Bulgarian well;
he has been a soldier and knows how to obey; he is
also strong, hardy and reliable. After I have talked
with Ilarian, you will find him ready to do anything
you ask from him. On receipt of the letter your man
brought me, I thought it well to attend to a few of the
preliminaries. At the wagoner&#8217;s you will find horses
bred in our own hills and inured to the mountains.
The wagoner has ready what you require and you
will find he will deal honestly with you. I shall pray
for you and the success of your venture. Ach&mdash;I
hear the voice of Ilarian&mdash;pray permit me to see him
alone first. Kindly make yourself at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Moskar left Morton puffing idly at his cigar.
He returned, however, in a few minutes followed by
a man of medium height, with broad shoulders, short
neck, close-cropped, round head, small, brown eyes
deeply set under bushy brows, and a heavy mustache
giving the deeply lined and tanned face a rather fierce
expression. His large hands with prominent knuckles
fingered nervously a well-worn plush cap. His stocky
limbs were encased in leather breeches and heavy cowhide
boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;This, honorable and gracious Herr Morton, is
Papiu Ilarian,&#8221; remarked the priest. Morton nodded
smilingly and a broad grin spread over Papiu&#8217;s face
as he shyly shuffled and bowed. &#8220;I have been speaking
to him and he tells me he is ready to start at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
He expects to receive two florins per diem, the customary
fee of an Alpine guide, and his term of hire
begins now and may end whenever you choose. I
have given him information about the character of the
work to be performed. You may rely on him. He
has a younger brother, Mihai, lately a resident of Roumelia,
who can also be hired, if you wish. He vouches
for him. Mihai, however, speaks very little German,
but he is quick and bold. I have sworn Papiu to obey
and follow you. He wishes to shake hands with you
to bind the agreement. If you will shake hands with
him, Herr Morton&mdash;the oath to me will have been
transferred to you. I will leave you together now
and will return when you call me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed gravely and passed through the door
silently.</p>

<p>Morton had been scrutinizing the face of the guide
while Father Moskar was speaking. Not a muscle
of it moved, nor did he stir an inch from his rigid
upright posture. The small, intelligent eyes looked at
Morton steadily with calm assurance.</p>

<p>Morton rose and offered his hand with a hearty
gesture. Papiu seized it in a vice-like grip. Morton
felt the man would be as true as steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papiu, when we get back, I shall pay you liberally,
and if we are successful, I shall make you rich!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr von Moorton&mdash;a bargain is a bargain. I am
your man and you are my master. Whatever your
nobleness orders&mdash;Papiu will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking boldly into Morton&#8217;s face, he continued:
&#8220;And my brother, he is good with horses, quick with
the rifle, has eye like a hawk and knows Roumelia
and the people. If I hire him for you, he will swear&mdash;and
his oath is good. You pay him the same money
and give his sweetheart a present when we come back&mdash;Mihai
will help good.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8220;Very well, Papiu, tell him he is engaged. And
now&mdash;let us go and look up the wagoner, where my
friend waits for us. Do you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen him judging the horses. He looks
good and strong and is kind to the beasts. He comes
with us, he my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, Papiu, let&#8217;s go then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton had a very busy time of it during the rest
of the forenoon. He found Donald waiting for him
and with his and Papiu&#8217;s help, they made the necessary
purchases and loaded the wagon. The things he had
shipped from Italy had been delivered and were also
included in the load.</p>

<p>During a frugal meal partaken of in the smithy,
Morton arranged that he would start early that very
afternoon by the regular train for Bucharest, in his
assumed character of prospective investor and buyer
of blooded horses. Donald and the two brothers were
to leave next morning with the vehicle and the relay
horses. They were to join him on Saturday at Padina,
where they would make arrangements for relay horses
and prepare a safe stopping place a night&#8217;s drive beyond
Padina on their way to the mountains.</p>

<p>Mihai now came on the scene and was duly introduced.
Papiu held some speech with him, looking
very serious and impressive. He explained to Morton
that the holy father had instructed Mihai and that his
brother would like to shake hands with Herr von
Morton. Morton accepted the hearty grip of the
mountaineer who smiled his gladness.</p>

<p>Mihai proved to be an elongated copy of his elder
brother. On being consulted, he suggested the &#8220;Bovu
Aro&#8221; (Golden Calf) Inn as a good rendezvous, a
little beyond Padina. Morton congratulated himself
on having secured the services of two such fine fellows.
He impressed upon them, however, the necessity for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
avoiding giving cause for suspicion to the natives of
the country they were about to travel, and especially to
steer clear of any military guards. His own man,
Don, would keep out of sight as much as possible, so
that a great deal would be left to their discretion. If
they were asked their business they were to say that
they were but going to market and returning; they
would enter Padina from the Northwest, on the road
running in from the Aluta Valley. On this road they
were to make a careful record of all telegraph stations,
villages and houses between their last stop and
Padina. He gave them money sufficient to carry them
on their way and for any further expenses they might
be compelled to incur. The two men said they understood
his instructions and would follow them carefully.</p>

<p>The horses were hitched into the shafts of the stout,
canvas-covered wagon now all loaded and ready. Don
and the two men got in; the wagoner mounted the
seat and with a parting good-bye and a crack of the
driver&#8217;s whip, they lumbered away, leaving Morton
alone in the yard. He looked after the wagon and
as he saw it disappearing in the distance, he speculated
as to what would be the outcome of this enterprise&mdash;an
enterprise so suddenly put to him and so suddenly
entered on. Surely it would end well! Nay, it must
end well. Putting all doubts out of his mind, he made
his way to Father Moskar&#8217;s rectory. He thanked the
old priest heartily for his kindness and promised to
come back and tell him the result of his undertaking.
The old man gave him his blessing in return.</p>

<p>At the depot he found his train waiting. It was
made up of a number of baggage cars and but one car
for passengers. Finding a comfortable seat, he amused
himself in watching the conductor, in resplendent uniform,
running alongside the train as he kept blowing
energetically through a little horn the signal to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
engineer to start. Soon the labored puffing of the
locomotive told him that he was at last on his way.
It was a wearisome journey, all up-grade, through
deep cuts and over widely stretched viaducts; but he
was too much occupied with anxious thoughts of the
coming days to notice the beauty of the mountain
scenery. He felt the pulling power of the engine and
realized hazily that they were climbing, climbing,
climbing. Suddenly it seemed to him as if the train
had been lightened of a load, and looking out he saw
that the engine had slowed down and that they had
arrived at a little station on a small plateau. A prominent
sign-post caught his eye. It was printed red,
white and green on one side, and a bright yellow and
crimson on the other. They had reached the boundary,
the divide, and all around him rose up the great peaks
of the Carpathians.</p>

<p>The gorgeous conductor stepped up to the compartment
and informed Morton that he would have to
change now. On the platform he found a number of
gendarmes busily engaged in examining the passengers&#8217;
baggage. One of these accosted Morton in foreign-sounding
German, and asked him for his valise
and passport.</p>

<p>Everything was found to be in order. The gendarme,
made happy by the gift of a cigar, ushered
Morton into another car on a side-track. A shrill
blast and the train moved slowly out. Soon the
descent began and the rapid motion roused Morton to
his surroundings. It was a truly magnificent sight to
behold. White peak on white peak gleamed in the brilliant
golden light of the afternoon sun. Then came
rounded hills and after these the sharper contours
of the Alpine range; and before he had had time to
take it all in, the train had entered the rolling meadows
and glades of the Great Danubian plain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>The splendid panorama had passed and Morton&#8217;s
interest subsided. He leaned back against the leather
upholstery of the compartment once more alone with
his thoughts. Occasionally the conductor would look
in at the window from the stepping board on the outside
of the car and nod pleasantly to him. Morton
would return the greeting automatically and resume
his meditations. Yes, he was learning, and learning
fast. In the desert from which he had but lately
stepped out, so to speak, a man was measured by his
offensive or defensive value&mdash;whether he would protect
himself or be a danger to others. In the countries
of civilization, he was similarly appraised, although
in terms of social standing or money. In this
isolated Transylvania, however, into which he had
come, he had found a difference. Here was a loyalty
founded on faith in human nature and religion. Father
Moskar had gently but firmly declined even his offer
of a contribution for the poor; while the two rough
men had refused more than their just wages for their
services. How different were these from those he had
known in his past life! Nay, how different even from
himself! Why had he undertaken this enterprise?
He could not help confessing to himself that his motives
were really selfish ones. What lay behind his
readiness to rescue the Count&#8217;s daughter if not his own
desires? Was not even love itself a selfishness&mdash;the
supremest of all selfishness?</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been too long in the desert,&#8221; he muttered
to himself; &#8220;it is high time I came back to civilization.
Man was not created to live alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The train crossed a bridge and the noise made by
the sound roused him to his whereabouts. He was
nearing his destination. The approach to the capital
of Roumelia was not marked by the usual signs of a
large city&#8217;s outlying districts. He missed the factories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and the tall chimneys belching forth smoke; he
saw no railroad crossings, or culverts, or streets
crowded with toilers. Instead, he made out, in the
dark and gloom of the fast oncoming evening, gaunt
buildings against a leaden sky and sparsely lit thoroughfares.
Then, with snortings and puffings, the
train entered the ill-smelling and smoky shed of the
depot. He was in Bucharest.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he alighted when a villainous looking
porter grabbed his valise from him and said some
words in a language which was Coptic to Morton. He
decided to allow the fellow to have his way and followed
him, through the press of outgoing people, to
the entrance. Here he found a uniformed individual
with a magnificent beard black as coal. Catching the
porter by his sleeve, he held him while he asked of the
soldierly Swengali, in English, the name of a good
hotel. He was evidently understood, for the uniformed
person spoke to the porter and in wretched English
asked Morton to follow him to the Grand Hotel Metropole.
John then noticed that the name of this hotel
was embroidered in gold on the man&#8217;s cap.</p>

<p>The porter was feed and relieved of his burden,
and Morton found himself installed in a hotel bus
which was soon rattling noisily over the stones. Arrived
at the hotel, he registered as from Cleveland, U. S. A.,
and was given fairly decent rooms.</p>

<p>His first business, after he had made himself presentable,
was to write a short note to Mr. Bronson,
the American Consul, to whom he had letters of introduction
from Brindisi. He invited him to dine with
him that same evening. Morton knew that there was
magic in his visiting card and had no doubt that his
invitation would be accepted.</p>

<p>This done, he leisurely descended the broad stairway
that led to the large and rather garishly decorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
foyer there to await the return of his messenger.</p>

<p>He had no sooner stepped into the hall than he was
accosted by a tall and lean individual in faultless
lounging suit, who addressed him in perfect French
by name and presented his card. He was M. Puscariu,
Agent of the Department of the Interior&mdash;Would
Monsieur Morton permit him to ask him a
few questions&mdash;excusable in the present state of the
country? He was sure that Monsieur would have no
objection.</p>

<p>Monsieur Morton had none. He held the card
before him and read the name slowly and with perfect
composure. Trouble was beginning already, he
thought. He begged Monsieur Puscariu to proceed.</p>

<p>The sergeant of gendarmes had reported that Monsieur
Morton had an American passport and had
registered from Cleveland. The passport, however,
had been issued at Rome, and within five days it
seems. Would Monsieur Morton kindly explain.</p>

<p>John was nonplussed. He looked anxiously around
for his messenger and, luckily, spied the boy just entering
and moving toward the clerk&#8217;s desk. If there
was one man on earth more than any other that he
wanted for a moment, it was the American Consul.
Begging Monsieur Puscariu to excuse him for a
moment, he hurried towards the messenger boy and
was informed by him that Signor Bronson would be
at the hotel without delay.</p>

<p>Greatly relieved, he rejoined Monsieur Puscariu
and informed him that the American Consul would
arrive presently and explain for him. In the meantime,
would not Monsieur join him in a cigarette? Monsieur
Puscariu would be delighted. What a bond of
fellowship there is in a smoke! It is well called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pipe of peace. Morton and the agent to the Secretary
of the Interior, as they sat together on the broad
lounge would, to a stranger entering the hotel, have
seemed to be life-long friends, so quickly had the
cigarette dissipated all feelings of restraint. Surely
it is the frailties rather than the virtues that cement
human relations! It would, indeed, seem as if it were
the touch of weakness which makes the whole world
kin. Perhaps, this it was which made Monsieur Puscariu
look on the American stranger as a gentleman.
Had he, however, entertained any other thoughts there
was no time to dwell on them for Mr. Bronson just
then entered hurriedly.</p>

<p>Morton rose to meet him and was greeted in return
with considerable effusion. When the Consul learned
the object of the agent&#8217;s presence, he drew the official
aside&mdash;and told him very impressively who this Mr.
Morton was. The change that came over the face of
Monsieur Puscariu was amusing. From an official
solemnity, it melted almost instantaneously into smiling
respect. Here was a man whose very breath was
odorous of ready cash. Ah, yes, this was quite a different
matter. There was no necessity for any explanations&mdash;none
whatsoever.</p>

<p>But Morton insisted. He informed the two gentlemen
that he was to be in Bucharest but for a few days.
He had come to make a preliminary and merely cursory
investigation of the status of certain oil concessions.
He was desirous to find out how the government would
take the investment of foreign capital for developing
this natural product of the country. At present, however,
he would prefer to engage an attorney of high
standing to make these inquiries and report to him.
Incidentally, he might seize the occasion of his visit to
secure some good stallions and a few brood-mares of
the celebrated strain of Carpathian percherons for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
farms in Ohio. These were his principal reasons for
asking the Consul to call on him.</p>

<p>Monsieur Puscariu and the Consul exchanged quick
glances&mdash;here was a fine opportunity for both. The
Roumelian was now convinced that the quiet young
man must be made much of&mdash;there was no doubt
about that. He was the more firmly convinced after
smoking one of Morton&#8217;s fine cigars and drinking a
glass of Tokay. He knew the very attorney for Monsieur
Morton&#8217;s business. He would send the gentleman
to call if Monsieur Morton desired it. As Monsieur
Morton did desire it, Monsieur Puscariu was
still more firmly convinced of John&#8217;s importance.
Assuring Monsieur Morton of his most sincere esteem
and promising that the honored visitor to his beloved
country would receive every consideration, the agent
bowed himself out, leaving John alone with the
Consul.</p>

<p>Mr. Bronson, a bright young fellow from one of the
South Atlantic states, quickly took occasion by the
ear and informed John of his disappointment with the
position he occupied in Bucharest. His salary was
far from adequate for his office. It was bad enough to
be in Bucharest before the political upheaval; but since
the revolution,&mdash;the place had become absolutely a
hell&#8217;s hole. There was no money in his job! His
fees for the past few weeks wouldn&#8217;t buy a square
meal.</p>

<p>If John had any scruples, they vanished at hearing
Mr. Bronson&#8217;s words. He felt himself justified in
throwing out hints of the &#8220;governor always taking
care of his friends,&#8221; and spoke of fees and commissions
for parties handling the proposition rightly. He
indulged in some &#8220;tall talk&#8221; about petroleum, and
asked the Consul&#8217;s opinion as to the fitness of the
attorney the agent had recommended. The Consul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
knew him and advised his retention; he was in with
the powers that be, and that, just now, was important.</p>

<p>The attorney was sent for and arrived so quickly
that Morton concluded Puscariu had not wasted any
time. The lawyer proved to be the very man he
wanted&mdash;shrewd, obsequious and greedy. A fat retainer
to this powerful gentleman and he was sure he
would neither be disturbed nor watched. From this
same individual he obtained the name of a breeder of
horses whose stud was an hour&#8217;s drive from Padina,
in a small town at the foothills of the Arges. He obtained
this information, as well as a letter of introduction,
on the plea that, as he would be going north for
a couple of days&#8217; hunting, he would like to utilize the
time looking for horses. He thought he would be
back in Bucharest the following Saturday or Sunday,
in which event he would advise the Consul and Mr.
Attorney.</p>

<p>When the two gentlemen left Morton, they were
both richer by many dollars than they had been prior
to their visit. They parted from him with still larger
hopes of future reward, and anxious to do the rich
American every service in their power.</p>

<p>Morton, as he mounted the staircase, congratulated
himself on having done a good day&#8217;s work&mdash;he was
convinced he had provided for the removal of many
unknown obstacles in his way.</p>

<p>In his room he sat down at the table and wrote the
following letters:</p>

<p>The first in German, and written with a stub pen
and in a disguised and uneducated hand, on plain
paper, was addressed to Sig. Jacobo Rosen, Casa
Cornu, Via Colomba, Padina. Rosen was the name of
the Jewish merchant recommended by Count Rondell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Sig. Rosen</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Your friend, the good Sig. Nimar, the merchant returning
from India, Arabia and Egypt, was taken seriously ill in
Italy and could not come in person. He has heard from
Constantinople and so as to admit settlement of the business
pending between yourselves has requested and empowered
me to act for him.</p>

<p>I shall be in your town to-morrow evening intending to
purchase horses from the Olata ranch for export. I desire
to buy the two famous mares about which Sig. Nimar spoke
to me.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival I shall call upon you and ask you to
arrange the affairs of your friend so that I can conclude
my business at an early date. I have moneys with me and
papers.</p>

<p>I shall stop at the &#8220;Bovu Oru.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">Most Respectfully,</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John R. Morton</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter he enclosed in a soiled envelope.</p>

<p>The second letter, written on the hotel&#8217;s paper and
with a fine pen, was addressed to his father at 210
Euclid Ave., Cleveland, Ohio, U. S. A.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bucharest</span>, October &mdash;&mdash;, 189&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>I arrived here to-night, and immediately got into touch
with the Consul, Mr. J. S. Bronson, and through him with
an attorney, Sig. Andra Jonescu, whose card I herewith enclose.
He was recommended to me as the best lawyer on
affairs of land titles, etc., and looks and acts like a capable
business man. He understands English well and you can
correspond with him directly. I have paid him his retainer
and he will make a preliminary report shortly.</p>

<p>I am going to try to get some good percherons from
the &#8220;Olata&#8221; ranch&mdash;our own strain will stand some new
blood. If I secure any good animals I will try and ship
them while I am here.</p>

<p>Everything appears to me to be quite normal; transfer of
titles would be perfectly legal and all acts of the <i>de facto</i>
government will stand test, I am told. We should have no
difficulty in dealing either with owners of land or the administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>Of course, I shall act with due caution and have some
official of high rank confirm this before acting finally.</p>

<p>The government, I am told, would welcome the investment
of foreign capital in land and industries and will give both
protection and guarantee.</p>

<p>I am well and have enjoyed the trip. I will not remain
longer than the business requires. I might get a chance
at some good shooting (there is fine game to be had in the
mountains and in the Delta), in which case I may prolong
my stay a few days. If I don&#8217;t get to Paris by November
20th, will cable.</p>

<p>With love to dear mother and Ruth, I am, dear father,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">Your loving son,</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Putting on his coat and cap, John walked down to
the foyer, and having learned from the gloriously
arrayed and imposing chief porter the location of the
nearest mail box, he leisurely sauntered toward it.</p>

<p>The street was totally deserted, not even a lighted
shop window was to be seen. This surprised him.
He had been told that Bucharest was known as the
&#8220;Paris of the East.&#8221; It looked like anything but that
just now. He surmised the change was owing to the
troubled times. As he slipped the letters into the mail
box, he had a feeling that he had been followed.
Without in the least betraying his suspicions, he paused
and lit a cigar and then slowly made his way back to
the hotel, smiling quietly. &#8220;You are welcome to read
both letters&mdash;but one of them, I guess, you won&#8217;t
recognize as mine,&#8221; he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>The next morning was spent in making a few
necessary purchases. He visited the principal streets,
and made it his business to look into the largest stores.
He observed that he was being followed wherever he
went; but he took no notice and went about his business
as if seeing nothing. The town was in that state
of suspended animation that betokens an unusually
unsettled condition. Shopkeepers seemed surprised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
find a patron; the few women he saw were sober and
barely let their glances fall on him, though it could be
easily seen that Morton was a stranger&mdash;he had taken
good care to get himself up like the typical English
tourist. Few conveyances of any description disturbed
the curious quiet that had come over the city,
a quiet as if from drowsiness.</p>

<p>Evidently, an ominous cloud was hovering over the
place, and Morton felt that he was walking on the thin
crust of a lake of molten lava, when any moment his
feet might break through. Wherever he went he was
certain to meet either a &#8220;Guarda Civil&#8221; with his fierce
mustachios, or an officer with clanking sword and
spurs, or a gendarme in his bizarre hat and baggy pantaloons
many inches too long for him. But no one
said a word to him, nor did he hear any words spoken.</p>

<p>He was not sorry to find that a train would take
him to Padina and land him there that evening.
Quickly packing a valise and informing the clerk that
he would retain his room, he made his way to the railway
station and found the train on time.</p>

<p>At the Padina depot, he inquired from a sleepy looking
guard after the best hotel, and was glad to have
the man point down the street to the very house he
had intended to stay at. It was but a short walk and
the foggy evening air hid the inhospitable appearance
of the place. But it could not hide the miserable condition
of the roadway, a trench-like, broad furrow,
between low, dingy buildings of box-like structure.
It was full of holes and pitfalls, and a pedestrian sank
ankle-deep in its mud. John recognized the hotel by
its swinging sign&mdash;an unnaturally meaty bull painted
with garish, coppery bronze&mdash;which glittered in the
feeble rays of an antiquated oil lamp fastened above
it. He set down his bag and with a resigned sigh
gave a vigorous pull at the bell-handle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>The door was opened by the landlord in person.
He looked astounded to see a man with a valise&mdash;evidently,
guests were not an event of everyday occurrence.
But his countenance quickly assumed its professional
smile and, with a nod of his unkempt head,
he invited Morton in. To Morton&#8217;s inquiries, he responded
in a curious jargon of German and Roumelian,
which Morton understood sufficiently to be satisfied
that he would find the accommodation he needed.</p>

<p>Bearing aloft an ill-smelling and smoky tallow candle
in a tin receptacle, the landlord led the way up a
stairway, the walls of which had been anciently plastered
and whitewashed. Arrived at the upper floor,
he entered a room and placed the light on a small
table and the guest&#8217;s bag on a most uninviting looking
bed. Then, turning, he gave vent to some more guttural
sounds and left Morton alone. The sounds were
intended to convey the information that the gentleman&#8217;s
dinner would be ready in half an hour in the
tap-room.</p>

<p>It was with many misgivings that Morton looked
about the cell that was to serve as his residence for
the next few days. The prospect was by no means a
pleasing one. The walls of a dirty white, roughly
plastered, showed many cracks and nail-holes, and
numerous blotches of soot or smoke where previous
visitors had evidently sent up burnt offerings on the
altar of a night&#8217;s peace from vermin. The bed, piled
high with pillows and quilts, assured warmth, but not
cleanliness; a rickety washstand with rough bowl
and pitcher, both chipped and cracked, two rickety
chairs, a small table, and a number of wooden pegs
driven into the wall, completed the furnishing. This
was the first real shock to John&#8217;s fortitude. He had
realized that he might have to encounter dangers, but
he never thought that he might be nauseated. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
camp in the desert, vermin and insects were a part of
the natural order of things, so to speak; but in this
&#8220;hotel&#8221;&mdash;faugh!&mdash;Morton&#8217;s lips twisted themselves
into an expression of disgust.</p>

<p>Still, it was an ill wind that did not blow some good.
The very primitiveness of the place would protect him
from an espionage which might prove to be far more
inconvenient than the discomfort. And he was not
just now interested in offering suggestions for running
model hotels. He was about to make up his mind
to risk a descent to the tap-room, for he was very
hungry, when a gentle knock sounded on the door.
Taking the battered candlestick in one hand and cautiously
opening the door, he peered into the dark stair-landing.
In the flickering light, the shadow of a man
stretching along the deal boards of the hall seemed
gigantic. But the feeling aroused by the size was
quickly dispelled by the voice which emanated from
the person. In a low, whining and apologizing tone,
and in a language which was intended for German,
the man inquired for the most honorable and respected
Signor Moor-ton.</p>

<p>John made himself known. The little man bowed
low, removed his hat, and begged permission to introduce
himself. He was the unworthy and humble
store-keeper Rosen, a purveyor to the wants of travelers
whatever their needs or desires might be. Would
not his Honor permit him to be the first merchant of
the town to offer his services to provide whatever the
gentleman wished to purchase in Padina? His stock
of goods was the choicest to be had anywhere outside
of Bucharest and the prices the lowest.</p>

<p>John was very much taken aback. Was this grotesque
and trembling shadow, this ridiculous little
figure the man in whom the Count had placed such
reliance? Was he to be the mainstay of his enterprise?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
It surely could not be. And yet he must have
come in response to the letter Morton had sent him,
the night before. Perhaps the fellow was playing a
part of set purpose! Still, it was an untimely hour
for a visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you come here? Why did you not wait
and see me downstairs? You Jews don&#8217;t waste any
time, that&#8217;s certain. Well, now that you are here, come
in and state your business. Be quick about it for I
haven&#8217;t much time!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had spoken roughly, and with a quick turn he
walked into the room.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WITH much bowing and scraping and apologetic
mumblings, the Jew passed through the
doorway and into the room. Once within,
he gave a quick turn and, closing the door quietly,
he carefully pushed home the bolt on the inner
panel. When he turned again, John was astonished
at the transformation in the man&#8217;s features and
bearing.</p>

<p>The bent figure had assumed an erect attitude and
carried a head surmounted by a brow indicative of
high intellectuality. In the light of the candle which
now shone fully on his face, the fine, dark eyes were
full of intelligence. He continued to speak in a whining
voice, as he held out a piece of paper to Morton,
of matters of trade; but as soon as Morton had taken
the paper from him he whispered: &#8220;Read while I talk.
Answer questions without using names; we may be
overheard or even watched.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whisper, in perfect German, was spoken with
the intonation of a man of education. John needed no
further explanation as to the real personality of his
uninviting caller. He examined the writing and read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pay no attention to what I am saying now&mdash;read!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you leave my patron?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you vouchers to prove who you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton walked to the table, and on the reverse side
of the paper wrote:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>&#8220;In ill health at Brindisi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have letter from Nimar and the Count&#8217;s ring;
countersign, &#8216;Arnim&#8217;s pledge.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want to take two girls out for a long drive.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed the paper back to the Jew, who never
ceased from talking and gesticulating while he glanced
quickly at the replies Morton had written. Morton
took the Count&#8217;s ring from an inner pocket and held it
out in the light. Rosen bowed courteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;All is well!&#8221; he said in low, clear tones. &#8220;To-morrow
morning at nine walk along the street to your
right, and under the third tree after passing the corner
you will see a small boy in a red cap, playing. When
he sees you, he will walk off. Follow him. He will
enter a doorway. Pass through after him. Twenty
paces further you will see an open gate in a high wall.
Pass through that also and bolt the gate after you.
To your right in the garden, you will find a green
door. It will be unlocked; enter, and if anyone asks
you your business say you want to see Sig. Rosen
about the rare old crucifix he offered you. My daughter
Rachel will be there. She will guide you. Is everything
clear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton nodded.</p>

<p>The Jew then resumed his cringing manner and,
backing softly to the door, he slipped the bolt back and
passed through, whining aloud in his sing-song tones:
&#8220;I thank your Honor for your indulgence. I hope you
will let me show you the articles I spoke of. I can
also exchange foreign money for our own. I have
beautiful jewelry that would please your ladies, and
very fine Turkish arms and antiques to show you. The
best and rarest articles from Persia and Anatolia can
be found in our town. I am your obedient servant&mdash;Good
night! and thank you, your Honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last words came up to Morton from the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of the stairway and were accompanied by the sound
of the man&#8217;s feet shuffling along the hallway.</p>

<p>Things were developing! Morton blew out his
candle and felt his way to the tap-room where he
found the promised supper awaiting him. The landlord
looked unconcerned and served him rather surlily
and with ill-concealed indifference. Sitting at a small
table in the corner, and removed from the range of an
oil lamp suspended from the ceiling in the middle of
the room, sat a man apparently engrossed in the contents
of a black bottle before him. Ah&mdash;this, then,
was the explanation for the Jew&#8217;s caution! The fellow
did not even glance at Morton, foreigner as he must
have struck any native to be. He was evidently there
for a purpose. Morton took no notice of him, but
busied himself in doing justice to the savory dishes
provided for him. He took his time about eating and
ordered a bottle of wine which he found excellent.</p>

<p>His hunger appeased, he invited the landlord to
help him finish the bottle. The landlord, nothing loth,
drank heartily and answered readily the questions Morton
put to him, which related only to horses and hunting,
and took a second bottle to satisfy. And still the
man in the corner said not a word, but kept on sipping
the liquid in his glass and staring vacantly before
him. When Morton had finished, he bade the landlord
good night and ascended the stairs to his room.</p>

<p>In spite of his first distaste for the bed, Morton
found it more inviting now that he had had a decent
meal and was feeling the effects of the wine he had
drunk with the landlord. He slept very soundly,
though his sleep was filled with dreams of running
fights with rough men and hairy beasts, of scaling
rocky heights and sliding into deep pits, of detectives
following him wherever he went and of a greasy-looking
Jew grinning at him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>When he awoke, the full daylight was slanting
through the openings of the blinds. He was soon
dressed and in the tap-room eating his breakfast. His
meal finished, he lit a cigar and walked carelessly
down the street.</p>

<p>Keeping to the right, he found, as Rosen had told
him, a boy, under the third tree, deeply intent on playing
with some glass balls. Before he had approached
to within some yards of the spot, the urchin had collected
his marbles and was throwing and catching his
fez in the air. When he had almost reached the lad,
the little fellow ran off and disappeared through a
low door in a plastered wall. Morton noted the spot
and, walking nonchalantly, passed through it, with a
carelessness of manner that betokened utter indifference.</p>

<p>He now found himself in a narrow garden plot
bordered by a red brick walk. There was little enough
in the garden to attract the attention&mdash;only a bed or
two of autumn flowers, and at the far end, a grape
vine roofing a small rustic kiosk. Beyond, the view
was cut off by a low rambling structure with heavy tile
roofing, the weather-worn eaves of which were covered
with deep moss. There was no sign of life anywhere,
except the chattering of a few sparrows in the dense
boxwood hedge along the walk, and the cooing of
some pigeons strutting on the brick walk.</p>

<p>Remembering the Jew&#8217;s instructions, he threw away
his cigar and turned to his right. A green door in
the plastered building confronted him. When he had
closed the door behind him a voice from the dark
shadows of the hallway called out: &#8220;Who is there?&#8221;
He gave his name to the invisible interlocutor and
added that he had come to see the crucifix Herr Rosen
had for sale.</p>

<p>By this time his eyes had grown accustomed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
darkness and he could make out the figure of a woman
approaching. A door was thrown open and he was
asked to enter.</p>

<p>The room in which he found himself was invitingly
cozy. It was furnished with an old-fashioned hair-cloth
couch and deep chairs. A finely carved round
table and an old desk, littered with papers, occupied
the rest of the space. The walls were covered in dark
leather and decorated with choice etchings. In a
corner a choicely carved cupboard stood out in its
classic distinction. He had barely time to note these
things when he heard the creaking of a door to his
left. The hanging was thrust aside and a small but
well-built young woman approached smilingly and
courtesied to him with quiet self-possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Herr Rosen&#8217;s daughter, Rachel. Please be
seated.&#8221;</p>

<p>John bowed, sank into the nearest chair, the bountiful
proportions of which he thoroughly enjoyed&mdash;it
was very comforting after his restless night. At once
the young woman plunged into the subject, speaking in
fluent German.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you wish me to tell you, Herr Morton?
Have no hesitation; you may trust me fully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here to take two ladies out of the country,
Miss Rosen. Perhaps it will be better if I do not give
their full names.&#8221; Miss Rosen nodded knowingly.
&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; continued Morton, &#8220;my first object
is to be introduced to Miss Mary and Miss Helène.
Then I want to find out how they are being detained.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Rosen hesitated for a moment and then spoke
rapidly as if she were thoroughly conversant with the
whole matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Marie is more or less a prisoner in the castle&mdash;exactly
opposite this house&#8221;&mdash;she pointed in the direction
of the red tiled building he had observed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
garden. &#8220;Miss Helène, however, is allowed more
freedom. She will be here in less than an hour. She
would not forsake Miss Marie and is with her as her
companion. She comes here every day after chapel
for some of the things they are permitted to have. She
is supposed to be at her prayers, but she comes to us
instead. I will see that you meet her in this room.
It would be no use for you to speak to Miss Marie;
the poor girl could not help you in any way. Miss
Helène is different. She will do whatever you ask
her if it means their freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are they confined, Miss Rosen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess&mdash;pardon the slip, but no one can
hear us here&mdash;Miss Marie is in the south wing of the
castle, adjoining the chapel, which is built close to the
enclosure of the grounds and at the South Gate&mdash;the
side entrance to the summer castle. If you go through
our house that way,&#8221; and she pointed to her right,
&#8220;you will reach Calla Aurel; almost directly opposite
to our house is the entrance gate. Marie is never allowed
to go out, but Helène is permitted to walk in
the town for an hour. If she exceeds that time, she
will not be allowed to go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Miss Helène could leave Padina if she
wished?&#8221; inquired John in surprised tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the gates of the town and the railway are
guarded day and night. No one can leave unobserved;
indeed, scarcely a soul has left town in the last two
weeks. But she could be gotten out of town, however,
if she could find anybody to undertake the task.
Father has offered to arrange it; but she declines to
go. Miss Helène will not leave the Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you suggest a way by which Miss Marie
could be smuggled out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know of only one way which I think would be
feasible.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>The young woman looked earnestly at Morton as
if trying to read his mind. &#8220;May I tell it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means. Your father has told me I can rely
on you. Tell me what you have in your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl smiled. &#8220;I will, but my plan requires quick
action. Our maid is the sister of Sergeant Valera,
who is in command of the guards at the south entrance
to the palace. One of the guards is her sweetheart&mdash;they
are to be married as soon as he can afford
it. The girl tells me that her Marco will do anything
for her. She can arrange that he shall be the guard
on any required night. The rest would be simple&mdash;merely
a liberal sum of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>John looked at the girl admiringly. &#8220;Splendid,
Miss Rosen, splendid! The money will be easy&mdash;I&#8217;ll
attend to that. Arrange for Marco to be the guard for
to-morrow night and I&#8217;ll get them both out of this
place. Can you manage it?&#8221; John had risen in his
excitement. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look over the ground now, if I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, Herr Morton,&#8221; came in quiet tones
from Miss Rosen. &#8220;You will only arouse suspicion.
Wait here for the present. Miss Helène will be here
now any minute and you can talk it over with her
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know best, dear lady,&#8221; and John, somewhat
calmed, reseated himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Herr Morton, what news from the
capital?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Things are in a very unsettled state there, I am
afraid, Miss Rosen. The fate of the royal family
and the imprisoned leaders of the nobility is not known
positively. The Parliament has adjourned for the
celebration of the feast of All Souls and will not
re-open until Saturday evening. It is expected that
Flava will, on that day, try to carry the assembly in
favor of his extreme views and that the Flavarists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and the liberal Left will cast their vote with him if he
so chooses. Everybody takes it for granted that he
will ask for a vote condemning the royal family and
nobility to expulsion or, perhaps, worse. He will not
spare any of them. In the cafés it is rumored that
he is seeking to duplicate the proceedings of the
French Chamber after the fall of the Gironde&mdash;and
you know what that means! If we are to act, we must
act promptly, or it may be too late. The two ladies
must be out of this town by Sunday at the latest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel&#8217;s face had grown pale. Her hands kept
crossing and uncrossing convulsively, and a look of
deep fear came into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;God of my people,&#8221; she whispered in an awed voice,
&#8220;this is terrible! You are right, Herr Morton, the
ladies must be taken away. Oh, Herr Morton&mdash;our
peasants and our townspeople here are so good and
obedient if only they are left to their own good natures.
So happy and contented! They love their
homes, they love peace and adore their king! Unhappy
land&mdash;the football of ambitious villains! Yes,
yes, Herr Morton, the ladies must be rescued. And
we, too,&mdash;my father and I will go also. God help us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton listened silently to this outburst, unable to
say a word. What crimes are not committed in the
name of liberty! And what fearful sufferings are not
endured for those so-called rights of man!</p>

<p>&#8220;Father has told me that you are an American. You
are the first from that country I have met. You look
as if you could accomplish what you undertake. Oh,
how I wish I could help!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can, nay, you are helping, Miss Rosen. But
you are too young to have such a burden and sorrow
thrust upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The daughters of our race become women very
early in life. We ripen soon. Our people have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to bear a life of persecution for many generations.
We know what it is to suffer. That has ever been the
lot of the Jew. Believe me, Herr Morton, ours is but a
brief childhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton could say nothing; he could but look the
sympathy he was feeling. The color had mounted to
the girl&#8217;s cheeks and she was speaking from an overflowing
heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;It will help you, perhaps, to know that my father
has always been very close to&mdash;to Miss Helène&#8217;s father.
They were friends for many years. Father is a very
learned and wise man, Herr Morton, and very brave
and loyal. Once he is your friend, he is always your
friend. You can rely on my father. He will be here
shortly. He is absent on purpose. He did not want
to be in when you called, so as to put off suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton could not help admiring the fine poise and
keen mind of this remarkable young woman&mdash;seemingly
a child in years, but a woman in sense. &#8220;You
and your father should come to my country, Miss
Rosen. Your father&#8217;s talents would be recognized
there, and you also, with your wit and beauty. In
my country, your people are powerful and honored.
Persuade your father, won&#8217;t you? If he needs help I
will help him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Herr Morton; but I hear some one
coming. It is Miss Helène.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rachel bounded up and was through the door in a
flash. In that moment, however, he realized whom he
was to meet. He stood up, his heart beating, and
waited. He had not to wait long, for the curtain was
pushed aside and the lovely face of the photograph was
framed in the doorway.</p>

<p>The clear, mellowed light which filtered through
the lace curtains of the windows fell full on the sweet
countenance and revealed the slender figure as it stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
against the velvet background of the portières. Miss
Rosen had thought it best not to come in with her.</p>

<p>The door behind the curtains closed with a gentle
click. She came toward the center of the room and
leaned one hand against the table whilst the other
timidly rested upon her bosom, which was rising and
falling in her agitation.</p>

<p>Morton&#8217;s gaze was riveted on her. He saw as in a
vision the pale face of soft contour, the delicate nose
with quivering nostrils above slightly parted tremulous
lips&mdash;moist as with the dew of innocent childhood,
the eyes encircled by dark shadows&mdash;blue eyes, the
blue of the wood-violet. She was more beautiful
than his dreams. She was looking at him with a pitiful,
questioning look, which went to his heart and
roused him from his state of trance. All his manhood
rose up in him in response to the appeal, and bowing
deeply, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Mr. John Morton, Comtesse, a friend of your
dear father. I am the bearer of a letter from him to
you.&#8221; He held the package towards her. &#8220;I am
here to be of service, if I can, to you and the Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>With her hand still upon her bosom, she whispered
rather than spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Rosen has told me you have letters from my
father&mdash;pray forgive me&mdash;I have been walking fast
and am a little out of breath&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the letter in a delicate, white hand and
saw that its envelope was unaddressed. It was sealed,
but in the corner she noted her father&#8217;s mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. Permit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With trembling hands she broke the letter and,
turning towards the window, began to read.</p>

<p>During the reading, John stood drinking in the
beauty of the agitated girl. He was exultant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
distressed by turns. Exultant in that fate had led
him to her&mdash;distressed at the sorrow that had come
into her life. Come what may, he would, at least,
rescue her from her present cruel position and bring
her to where life would be worth living. His whole
soul welled up in him, and it was only after a great
effort of will that he calmed himself to the exigencies
of the moment.</p>

<p>The letter read, the girl dropped her arms listlessly.
She turned to Morton, her eyes filled with tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;How was my father when you left him, Mr. Morton?
Was he very ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice broke a little from the stress of her
feelings. She spoke in excellent English, though
with a distinctly foreign accent, and both tone and
words went to the young man&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Rondell was not well, but he was not suffering.
He wished me to hand you this ring as a
further guarantee of myself. I was also to repeat to
you his message: &#8216;From Arnim to his Kindchen.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène broke down utterly at these words. She
took the ring with trembling hand and kissed it passionately
the while tears coursed down her pale
cheeks.</p>

<p>John turned away and watched the sparrows flitting
across the garden. The scene in the stateroom
with her father rose before his mind, and again a deep
yearning filled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Mr. Morton. My father&#8217;s letter unnerved
me. What am I to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>John turned a face full of smiling sympathy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse, let me first assure you that I am entirely
at your service. Your father could only suggest
some plans, but I hope I shall be able to find
a way out. But, pray, be seated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Comtesse Helène sank into the chair lately occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
by Miss Rosen. She looked up at Morton with
eager questioning in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you obtain for me an interview with the Princess,
Comtesse?&#8221; Morton asked.</p>

<p>Helène shook her head. &#8220;That would be impossible,&#8221;
she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it may not be necessary. Miss Rachel has
suggested a plan which fits in excellently with the
preparations I made before coming to Roumelia.
Could you and the Princess be ready to leave by Saturday
evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène gasped with wide eyes. Morton, seeing her
state of mind, smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear, dear lady, all will be well. But
you will help me if I know how to proceed. Are
either of you permitted to leave the castle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I&mdash;I can go out every forenoon for an
hour. The Princess is not permitted to leave the
castle. We live on the second floor of the wing adjoining
the chapel&mdash;the wife of Captain Gradsiano,
of the guard, shares the floor with us. On the floor
below us are the guard rooms and the Captain&#8217;s
office. We are permitted to go to chapel for our
devotions every morning and evening and on Sundays
for mass at eleven. I am the only attendant on
the Princess. Signora Gradsiano sends a woman
with our meals at the regular hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes with you to chapel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse, to-morrow, on your way to vespers,
walk as close to the gate as you can. I understand
the chapel adjoins the South Gate. I shall be there
with my men, ready to take you both away. A
closed carriage will be in waiting, with good horses.
Bring nothing with you, for everything will be provided
for your comfort and needs. Put on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
stoutest shoes and your stoutest hearts. If you have
any papers or jewels that you value you may bring
them, but nothing else. Will you do this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where are we going to?&#8221; the girl asked
piteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father instructed me to take you to Thuringia.
Did he not tell you that in his letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He says I am to follow her Highness there.
But how are we to get there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see to that, Comtesse. Every preparation
has been made, even to the securing of fresh horses
for the road. Believe me, you need have no fear. I
have trusty men to help me, and they will be ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton spoke confidently and looked the confidence
he felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time flies, Comtesse. Your hour is almost up.
When you see the Princess, pray tell her of the plan
and see that she is ready. I will be here to-morrow
at this time and give you final instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl rose, her lips trembling and her eyes filled
with doubt. She walked slowly to the curtained
door, her head bent. John drew aside the drapery,
and opening the door bowed deeply, saying: &#8220;Until
ten to-morrow, then, Comtesse. I beg of you to be of
good cheer; and permit me to say that we are deeply
devoted to your cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène bowed her head lower and left the room
without a word.</p>

<p>Once more he was alone&mdash;but not lonely. He had
seen her and spoken to her&mdash;face to face. He felt
as if he had been on that high mountain and had
come down again, his face shining. &#8220;God is good
to me,&#8221; he breathed to himself. He was grateful
for the silence of the room, grateful also that no one
came in to disturb his thoughts. Mechanically he
sat down and lit a cigarette. Everything was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
well&mdash;everything would go well, if the Princess
agreed. How easy it would be if the Comtesse alone
were concerned! And as he thought of Helène his
whole being dissolved into pity. How worn she
looked and yet how beautiful! The blue of her eyes
was the color of heaven itself. Would they ever shine
on him with love?</p>

<p>The sound of voices in the hall woke him from
his dreams. A moment later the door was pushed
open and the alert face of Rachel with its dark and
flashing eyes showed itself in the doorway. She was
followed into the room by her father.</p>

<p>The Rosen who appeared now was an entirely
different Rosen from the servile trader of the previous
evening. He was neatly dressed in sober black
and faultless linen, and gave the impression of being
a scholar rather than a tradesman. As Morton shook
hands with him, he could not help noting the well-cared-for
fingers which met his in a hearty pressure.
A smile lighted up his features. John was drawn to
the man.</p>

<p>In obedience to a nod from her father, Rachel withdrew
and left the men to themselves.</p>

<p>John was full of his plans and eager to have
Rosen&#8217;s opinion. The latter listened attentively to all
the details, nodding occasionally in approval. Morton
had taken from his pocket a map of the country,
laid it on the table and pointed out the routes he had
arranged on. Rosen agreed that the plan was a
good one, but as John alone was to get the girls out
of the castle it would be necessary for him to have a
diagram of the town. Rosen supplied this by drawing
one very carefully on a sheet of paper. He advised
John that bribes were dangerous in the present
juncture of affairs&mdash;there was too much risk in them.
There would, however, be nothing to fear from Marco.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Once the girls were out of the town the sparsely settled
country would offer few obstacles to his getting
across the border. If John could cut the telegraph
wires on the way as he planned to do, it would help
by delaying the police.</p>

<p>But he would meet his greatest difficulty in the
actual crossing of the border, thought Rosen. There
was no road over the mountains for hundreds of
miles, except by means of the passes, and these were
well guarded by the military and the Lingari gendarmes.
If he attempted to cross without a passport,
Herr Morton might have to fight for it. That was
the weak part of the plan. Did Herr Morton realize
it?</p>

<p>John coolly said he did realize it; but he would
take the risk. He was of the firm opinion that he
would manage to get through somehow.</p>

<p>Rosen suggested that Morton and his men should
pass as smugglers. Tobacco smuggling was quite
common over the border, and the guards were amenable
to the persuasive power of gold. &#8220;It&#8217;s the yellow
metal, Herr Morton,&#8221; remarked Rosen with a
smile, &#8220;and not paper, that will get you across.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton said that he would see to it that he had a
sufficient supply of this with him.</p>

<p>These matters having been settled to both their
satisfactions, John begged Rosen to instruct his
daughter to purchase a proper outfit for the young
ladies&mdash;an outfit proper for the journey and at the
same time befit their station in life. Rosen promised
to see to that, and the two men parted for the day.</p>

<p>The late noon found John at his hostelry partaking
of an excellently cooked dinner served in the most
primitive fashion. He then drove out to the Olata
ranch, where he purchased several fine horses and
arranged for their removal on the following Monday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
His man, he told the horsedealer, could call for them
and pay the balance of the purchase price.</p>

<p>John had now done everything that would bear
out the statement he had made as to the purpose of
his visit to Roumelia. He was satisfied that there
would be no cause for suspicion. He would retire
early, since it was imperative he should be fully prepared
for what had to be done the next day. The
morning would find Donald and the men in Padina,
and he must be up betimes to give them their instructions
for the evening.</p>

<p>The man he had seen drinking in the tap-room the
night before was sitting in the same place busily engaged
eating. As before, he took no notice of the
stranger in English clothes, and John was well satisfied
that it should be so. Evidently, the authorities
were still deeply interested in him.</p>

<p>The windows rattled from a strong wind which had
risen. Gusts found their way through cracks in
the panes, chilling the room and almost extinguishing
the candle. But John&#8217;s thoughts were far away
from the wretched room in which he lay. He was
in a palace in his dreams, gazing at the beautiful
maiden who walked in stately grace over its marble
floors.</p>

<p>A great gust almost blew the shutters off their
hinges. John awoke and shivered. The wind was
roaring outside. &#8220;Good,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;a storm will
be my Providence.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MORTON had set the alarm clock for a very
early hour, so that it was still almost dark
when its insistent ringing roused him from
his slumbers. He was still drowsy and scarce knew
where he was. Then he remembered that the day was
Saturday and the place Padina. In a moment he was
out of bed and dressing rapidly in the dawning daylight.
He was thinking quickly, too, wondering if
Rachel Rosen had arranged with the maid&#8217;s sweetheart,
Marco. That was the key to the first gate
which barred the undertaking. If she had failed, then
there was nothing for it but to make a bold dash
and, if the worst came to the worst, fight for it. Well,
he would be ready even for that, though he hoped
sincerely it would not come to that.</p>

<p>But another doubt assailed him. Would the Princess
be willing to take the step? Confound the Princess!
He would compel her to go. He would not
permit himself to stand on ceremony, now that everything
had been arranged.</p>

<p>Morton hurried below and found a stupid-looking
lout sweeping the tap-room floor. The door of the inn
stood open, and a cold damp wind was blowing into
the room. He stepped out and saw with satisfaction
that it was raining heavily, with a cold east wind
blowing in sharp gusts. Returning to the room he
inquired of the servant if his breakfast was ready;
but the man looked at him blankly with unintelligent
bovine eyes. Evidently he was not understood. Resorting
to signs he finally got the fellow to catch his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
meaning, for he ceased dusting and began to lay the
table.</p>

<p>From the back part of the inn came now the sound
of wheels rumbling on cobblestones. John realized
that this must mean the arrival of Papiu. Stepping
quickly through the hallway to the rear exit he saw
the very man alighting from a primitive and cumbersome
conveyance, the wheels of which would have
supported a six-inch gun. Papiu took no notice of
John, but kept looking at the sky and examining the
house. Morton caught his cue from the man&#8217;s actions
and returned to the tap-room, where he found his
breakfast waiting for him. A few minutes later
Papiu entered, dripping wet, and, seating himself by
the table adjoining the one at which John was eating,
called loudly for the waiter. The landlord, in shirt-sleeves
and leather apron, appeared now on the scene,
and after exchanging a few words withdrew to attend
to Papiu&#8217;s requirements.</p>

<p>Immediately they were alone, the driver leaned
over and deftly slipping a piece of paper into John&#8217;s
hands, quickly resumed his seat and yawned lazily
and loudly. Morton read the note, which was from
Donald.</p>

<p>Everything had been done as ordered and all was
ready. Mihai was waiting with the reserve team at
the crossroad, Kilometer 34 of the map, and Papiu&#8217;s
saddle horse was just beyond the town gate. He,
Don, would remain in the wagon until he received
further orders from Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>John was greatly relieved. Returning to his room,
he put on a heavy ulster. On his way through the
tap-room he whispered to Papiu, who was munching
black bread and fat bacon, &#8220;Remain here till you hear
from me,&#8221; and passed out into the rain.</p>

<p>The street was utterly deserted. Disregarding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
sweeping, cold downpour, he made his way to Rosen&#8217;s
house by the gateway he had entered the day before.
Rachel greeted him cordially and smilingly put aside
his apologies for his soaking condition. It was the
very weather father had been praying for, she told
him. When he was snugly seated in the room which
had now become sacred to him, she told him that
everything had been arranged as they had planned.
Marco would be on guard at the South Gate between
five and seven that evening. The watchword was
&#8220;Luna Dragu.&#8221; He would permit two ladies to pass
out unchallenged. It had been settled that after he
had been relieved Marco was to strike out for the
big river, where his people would be waiting for him,
and cross over into Bulgaria. His sweetheart would
meet him there later. As to the clothes for the girls,
she pointed to three packages, each marked with a
number. No. 1 was the Princess&#8217;s, No. 2 the Comtesse
Helène&#8217;s and No. 3 the articles both ladies might use
in common. John was perfectly satisfied, and expressed
his sincere thanks for all the trouble she had
taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only too happy to serve them,&#8221; Miss Rosen
replied. &#8220;I shall be fully repaid when I know they are
once again in a safe place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may rely on me, dear lady,&#8221; said John earnestly,
&#8220;to do everything in my power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father will be in soon,&#8221; remarked the girl, &#8220;he&#8217;s
just gone out to the café to hear the news. Won&#8217;t
you sit in his office until he returns? You may smoke
there,&#8221; she added, laughing.</p>

<p>John thanked her as she led him into a small but
well-furnished study adjoining. &#8220;Here is where
father does all his important business,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You will be quite safe here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I will wait for Mr. Rosen&#8217;s arrival.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>The bright girl courtesied, and with a look of admiration
at John left the room precipitately. Left
alone, John lit a cigar and began studying the map
he always carried with him. He calculated that he
would make Kilometer 34 in about four hours, despite
the rain and bad roads. This would mean that their
first resting place would be some thirty kilometers
further in the mountains. That would be well, indeed.
But, again, doubts arose in his mind as to what the
Princess herself would do. She was the unknown
quantity which he knew not how to allow for. However,
he would cross that bridge when he came to it.</p>

<p>The door was softly opened and Rosen entered, carefully
closing it behind him. The two men wasted no
time in idle talk but set themselves at once to the
business in hand. Rosen was pleased to learn that
the team and the men had arrived. He himself would
see to the delivery of the packages at Herr Morton&#8217;s
inn to Papiu. It would not be necessary for John
to return to the inn as he, Rosen, would discharge
the bill and see to his baggage. The landlord was all
right, there was nothing to fear from that quarter;
but there were spies about. He knew that. He was
glad of the storm; it would be their best friend.
Everything was working for them and&mdash;Rosen would
see to the rest.</p>

<p>John was greatly relieved. He had to confess to
himself that the enterprise had assumed, now that
he was face to face with it, a rather dangerous aspect.
He could never have managed without the
assistance of this devoted man and his equally devoted
daughter. He thanked Rosen, and proceeded to count
out the gold for Marco, which Rosen would deliver.</p>

<p>John found the merchant quick and decisive in
action, and a most interesting companion. He was
a great admirer and devoted adherent of Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Rondell, whom he regarded as his benefactor. And
as for the Comtesse Helène&mdash;ah&mdash;he and his would
gladly die for the dear young lady. He mourned the
sad turn of affairs, which for the time being, at least,
would leave the Count penniless. He, Rosen, would
remain in Roumelia for some time to look after Count
Rondell&#8217;s affairs as best he could.</p>

<p>A discreet knock and Rachel whispered: &#8220;The Comtesse
is awaiting Mr. Morton in the sitting room.&#8221;
Morton rose at once and made his way to the room.</p>

<p>Helène stood near the window, apparently in deep
thought. She was dressed in the identical garments
she had worn the day before, but she looked even
paler than then. Evidently she had spent a restless
night. Her eyes were heavy, with dark rings around
them; but the blue in them was a glimpse of heaven
to Morton. She returned his cheery greetings with
a wan smile and in words scarcely above a whisper.</p>

<p>John placed a chair and begged her to be seated.
He told her of the success their preparations had so
far met with and assured her smilingly that all would
go well. What had the Princess said?</p>

<p>Helène sat and looked as if she were not listening
to him. Her lips quivered and she nervously fingered
the lace handkerchief she was holding in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton, Her Highness is afraid to trust herself
to a stranger. She is unstrung and I have not
succeeded in persuading her to act as you propose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène leaned forward, resting her elbows upon her
knees, and pressed the lace against her tired eyes.
Suppressing a sob with a quick intake of her breath,
she continued in a trembling voice, though with no
trace of resentment in it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did not papa send someone we know&mdash;one of
our own people? Please, do not misunderstand me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I have done all I could&mdash;I told her everything you
bade me say,&#8221;&mdash;the tears were not to be denied now;
they fell slowly unchecked.</p>

<p>John felt as if he would choke. It was as he had
feared! He looked at Helène confounded and utterly
at a loss what to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not blame Her Highness, Mr. Morton. She
has had much to bear. She has been waiting, hoping,
expecting news from her brother, the Prince, who
was abroad when the dreadful upheaval came. She
has not heard a word, and she is almost distracted.
She cannot believe that she is alone now&mdash;that she has
no friends any more. And I don&#8217;t know how to convince
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton had recovered himself. He no longer felt
any commiseration for the Princess but instead an
overpowering resentment filled him. Was this girl
to be sacrificed to satisfy an hysterical weakling of
a Princess? Once the Comtesse returned to the castle,
she would be a prisoner for the day, and the arrangements
for the evening would have been made for
nothing. Why, it was absurd, ridiculous! Confound
all Princesses! He must take things in his own hands
now.</p>

<p>His face flushing he rose and planted himself firmly
before Helène. &#8220;Comtesse, under the circumstances
there is but one thing to do. I am ready now, this
very minute, as ready as I shall ever be. In half
an hour the team will be here. You will get into it
just as you are and we shall start north at once! The
Princess has chosen, and we&mdash;we cannot be expected
to sit down and wait for Providence or a miracle!
I shall call Herr Rosen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He expected, nay, dreaded, a breakdown and a
flood of tears. But in place of hysterics, he met a
woman as determined and as proud as himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Helène rose, her eyes flashing, her face pink with
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you, sir, speak of Her Highness in
that manner! How dare you take advantage of my
helplessness! I am a Rondell, sir, and a Rondell has
never forsaken his king. My duty and my choice are
with the Princess. Permit me, sir, to retire.&#8221;</p>

<p>John was dumbfounded. This was worse than anything
he had even dreamed of. Good God, she must
not be permitted to leave the house. What was he to
do? Where was Rosen or Rachel? He must plead
with her until one or the other came.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beseech you, Comtesse, not to do anything rash!
I implore you to be calm and to listen to me! I assure
you, nothing was further from my thoughts than
disrespect towards the Princess or yourself. Will
you not oblige me by permitting me to reason with
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène, somewhat calmed, looked piteously at Morton.
Her resentment had vanished and in place of
the proud royalist there stood the helpless woman-child.
Her lips quivered and the tears fell uncontrollably.
She collapsed rather than sat in the chair,
her head sank upon her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, papa&mdash;why did you abandon me?&#8221; she
moaned. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come for us yourself&mdash;why
did you leave me here without anyone to advise
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Anguish in face and heart, John stood gazing at
her in pitiful sympathy. He realized what a hard
fight the child must have gone through&mdash;pleading and
persuading with the Princess. He began to think
quickly. He must abandon reasoning and plead&mdash;plead
and beg for a favor. He remembered some
words his father had once said to him: &#8220;Never argue
with a woman, my boy; kneel down to her, confess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
you have been wrong, throw yourself upon her
mercy&mdash;beg forgiveness. She will follow you
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse, I beg you once more to forgive me!
Pray listen to what I have to say.&#8221; He broke off
with a catch in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have traveled five thousand kilometers&mdash;to get
here. I have disobeyed the call of my loving parents,
of a father who is ill, of a mother who has not seen
me&mdash;her only son&mdash;in years. I have come here with
other brave and loyal men, to bring you out of this
dangerous land. Be just to me, dear lady. I may
not have the fervor of loyalty for royalty, for I am an
American&mdash;a republican. In my country kings and
queens are but as other men and women. It is their
worth that counts with us there. I wish I could have
brought your dear father with me. But that was
impossible. He sent me to act for him. Your father
is most devoted to Her Royal Highness, and I&mdash;I am
ready to do all that he would have done. But first
in his heart is his child. He enjoined me, Comtesse,
to think of the Princess first; but, if I could not prevail
there, I was to think of you. &#8216;For God&#8217;s sake,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;help my child.&#8217; That is why I am here,
and that is why I spoke as I did. If I have done
wrong I beg you to pardon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>John had put his whole heart into his words.
Helène lifted her head and turned her eyes on him
in questioning wonderment. But he left her no time
to interpolate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you blame me, dear lady, if your words unbalanced
me? Faithful to my promise to your noble
father, I have made every preparation. My men are
ready and waiting. They will perish if the Princess
fails us at this the eleventh hour. And after to-day
there will be no hope; for to-morrow the tyrant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Bucharest will inaugurate a reign of terror and God
alone knows what will happen to us all, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène&#8217;s eyes showed the remorse she was feeling.
She gazed with awed look at the man who had thus
unselfishly taken upon himself a duty which should
have concerned her own kin. She was ashamed of
her words and knew not how to express her changed
feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse, will you not speak with the Princess
again? Tell her of what I have said now. Convey
to her your father&#8217;s earnest desires. She should think
of that, for your father was her father&#8217;s most devoted
friend. A new duty has devolved on her; in addition
to the duty she owes to herself, she owes a duty to
Count Rondell, to you and, I will say it, to me, who
has her honor at heart. I am now, I must say
it, the one hope left. Assure her that she may trust
me implicitly. Your noble father, the Count, would
not otherwise have sent me. Go back to the Princess
and use your most persuasive powers. If she
consents, all will be well, and I shall be very happy.
But give me, first, your solemn promise that, come
what may, Princess or no Princess, you will be at the
chapel at six o&#8217;clock this evening, and that you will
come to the gate where I shall be waiting for you.
Comtesse, I cannot let you go without that promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eagerness had carried him away. He stepped
up close to the trembling girl and took her unresisting
hand and held it firmly in his own warm, strong
one.</p>

<p>With parted lips and with wide eyes Helène had
taken in every word of his passionate pleading. This
man would keep his word. She was satisfied of that
now. And her father had written to her: &#8220;Obey implicitly
and follow Mr. Morton&#8217;s instructions absolutely.&#8221;
He must be right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>Trembling she groped for the little cross hanging
upon her breast. God would not let the dear Princess
perish&mdash;and she&mdash;? Well, she would try again&mdash;she
would convince her mistress!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Morton, yes! I will do what I can. I
promise everything. You are right&mdash;we must act at
once! But, oh, what will happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was trembling all over, fearful of the picture
her fancy had conjured up.</p>

<p>Morton, still holding her hand, gently led the girl
to her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Comtesse, be calm and take heart. Nothing
at all will happen. We shall get away and you
will be safe and happy in a few hours. Do not fear.
I swear to you that we shall bring you safely across
the border.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène grew calmer. She felt her native energy
coming back, and with a blush she gently withdrew
her hand from Morton&#8217;s grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton, I want to thank you for your goodness
and your forbearance. You have been more than
kind. I promise to be at the gate at six; with the
Princess if I can, and as I pray I may be&mdash;alone, if
I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>John had won. Rising and bowing with reverence
before the beautiful young woman:</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse&mdash;I thank you. I shall always cherish
your brave and noble words. And now, if you will
permit me, I must give you your instructions. Take
nothing with you, so that no suspicion may be aroused.
The corner window opening toward the street is, I
understand, that of your room. I shall watch that
window. If the Princess consents to go, leave the
curtains closed as they are now. If she does not,
draw them apart, and I will understand. On your
way to chapel, walk slowly along the chapel front,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
which will be in deep shadow at that time, and go
to the South Gate. The sentinel will not stop you.
The small door nearest the wall will be open and I
will be awaiting you there. If the Princess is with
you, lead her. And now, Comtesse, until six this
evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of Helène&#8217;s steps in the hall brought
the alert Rachel in apron and turned-up sleeves from
the kitchen. She glanced questioningly at Morton,
who simply nodded and said: &#8220;The Comtesse knows
what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest of the day passed quickly in the house of
the Rosens. A very excellent dinner was served him
by his hostess. After dinner he smoked his cigar
and chatted with Herr Rosen in the study. Later he
sat in the little enclosure fitted as a counting room
adjoining Rosen&#8217;s store, and looked across the quiet
street at the gray walls of the castle. The storm
had abated somewhat though the rain still came down
and kept the street deserted. Through the grayish
veil of mist he could distinguish the solitary figure
of the sentry in hooded cloak, rifle reversed with bayonet
pointing downward, slowly walking back and
forth. He could not help speculating what the night
would bring. Now and again he would look up at the
window, but no sign of parted curtains was to be
seen. Towards dark Rosen came to inquire if he
had received any word. No, the curtains still remained
closed.</p>

<p>An early and silent supper was hastily partaken of,
and sunset found each man at his post. John saw the
wagon drawing up at the gate in the narrow street
to the rear. Good, Donald and Papiu were on the job.</p>

<p>Don, who was introduced to Rachel, seemed to be
the least nervous among them all. He took things
phlegmatically as if they were a part of his regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
duties. Outside the wind had shifted and blew as
strongly as ever. The men waited for the hour to
strike. Rachel came in and told John that the maid
had reported to her that Marco was on duty. John
shook hands with her silently. Then, with a final
word of warning to Don, he hurried to his post.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MORTON braced himself against the gusts of
wind and squalls of icy rain which drenched
his face and body. It was with difficulty
that he was able to see his way. There was no need,
he said to himself, to keep a lookout on a night like
this. All the better. The flickering smoky flame of
the oil-lamp over the main gate cast a faint yellow
light around and threw ghostlike, moving shadows
about the entrance. Stumbling frequently against the
large pebbles in the roadway and wading almost ankle-deep
through pools of muddy water, he managed to
reach the denser blackness along the castle wall, and
stopped under its protection to take a breath.</p>

<p>Glancing toward the sentry-boxes he saw the outline
of a human figure as a dim motionless silhouette.
His hand sought the butt end of his ready revolver,
and the touch gave him confidence. Cautiously he
groped for the door. It yielded easily to his pressure.
With careful glances he satisfied himself that no one
was about&mdash;the street totally deserted&mdash;the only
sounds to be heard were the steady splash and beating
of the rain and the groaning roars of the wind.</p>

<p>Through the heavy bars of the gate he could see
the dim murky rays filtering through the befogged
window panes of the guardroom under the wing
which harbored the girls. As he stood peering into
the distance a faint light shone through the transom
over the entrance to the chapel, and he knew they
were lighting up the place. It was followed by red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and green rays of light streaming through the stained-glass
windows of the nave.</p>

<p>Some minutes, which to John seemed an age,
passed, when the sound of a plaintive bell was borne
to him in muffled tones on the damp, foggy air. It
was the vesper bell. Immediately through the drifting
veil of slanting rain he perceived figures flitting across
the vaulted opening in the castle wing. He was conscious
of some one moving in the shadow on his right,
and before he realized it, a heavily cloaked figure came
into view followed by a similarly clothed but smaller
form, a bare rod behind.</p>

<p>Morton at once pushed the gate open and waited
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I&mdash;Morton,&#8221; he whispered, as the first figure
neared him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Helène and&mdash;&#8221; she seized her companion&#8217;s
hand, too excited for words.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must hurry&mdash;quick, quick,&#8221; he whispered
sharply. He led them along the shadowy border so
as to avoid the range of light, and urge them across
the street to the scant protection of the trees along the
opposite pavement.</p>

<p>He could almost hear his heart beating above the
panting of the girls by his side. He dared not run
and feared to walk too slowly. One minute and the
worst would be over.</p>

<p>Helène walked steadily, but her companion stumbled
frequently and was trembling in every limb as she
held on to his arm. Ah&mdash;here at last was Rosen&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>Donald was ready and passed the girls through
without a moment&#8217;s delay. They were met by Rosen,
who stood, his hands up as if in the act of blessing,
in the dimly lit hall. The noise brought Rachel from
the sitting room. She guided them through the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to the exit on the further side. With an affectionate
pressure of Helène&#8217;s hand and a kiss on the sleeve
of the Princess&#8217;s cloak, she murmured her parting
wishes.</p>

<p>Once more they were in the rain, but this time
sheltered from view by the walls of the garden. Donald
walked ahead, lantern in hand, and opened the
gate for the girls to pass through. Behind them came
Morton alert and ready.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they arrived at the place where
the wagon stood waiting. Quickly lifting the Princess,
he whispered to her to lie down on the right.
Then turning to Helène he gently passed her in bidding
her lie to the left. The next instant the blackness
of the cart&#8217;s interior had swallowed him also,
and the vehicle rumbled and splashed its way as if
it were being driven to market. Don alone remained
without, walking rapidly by its side and searching
intently to the right and left.</p>

<p>The girls huddled close together, and lay with their
arms about each other. The rain beat down on the
canvas covering, drowning all other sounds; only occasionally
could they hear the crunching of the wheels
rolling clumsily over the roughly paved road. It was
with difficulty that they kept themselves from falling
on one side or the other. As they were wondering
what might happen, they heard the voice of Morton
raised above the din, assuring them, in German, that
everything was going well; they need have no anxiety.
He would light the lantern after they had put the town
gate behind them. He had barely finished speaking
when the wagon gave a great lurch and bounded forward
with a fearful clatter. They had entered the
main road leading out of the town, an abominably
paved causeway which seemed to have been made for
preventing anyone either leaving the place or coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
into it. It was with the utmost difficulty that John
could now make himself heard but he managed to
convey to the girls the information as to where they
were and that they would soon arrive at the gate. It
would be necessary for them to keep perfectly quiet,
until that danger was passed.</p>

<p>Helène held on to the hand of the Princess, whispering
endearing and encouraging words. She knew
that Morton would protect them at all hazards,
even though she could not see him. He had shown
her that he was neither a man to be trifled with nor
one to give in at the first difficulty. Her thoughts of
him were of confidence; she remembered the appealing
words he had spoken to her that morning. He
was brave, or her father would not have sent him,
and he must be good or her father would not have
trusted him.</p>

<p>The wagon rumbled less now, and the driver could
be heard speaking to his horses. The wheels crunched
the gravel more heavily as they turned more slowly,
and the next moment they had come to a halt. Soon
voices were heard, and a shaft of light streamed into
the wagon through a small opening in the canvas
covering at the rear. Helène saw John looking out
from between the canvas flaps. He was crouching
silently, a pistol in each hand.</p>

<p>A loud laugh followed by a command and some
exclamations, and then a cheery: &#8220;Bene, avante.&#8221;
The rain was now falling in a soft patter on the cart&#8217;s
covering, so that the clinking sound of the driver
urging the horses on could be easily heard. A creaking
of the harness, and they were off once more at a
slow trot.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are safe,&#8221; came in a loud whisper from John.
&#8220;A few minutes more and we can have a light.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time since they had left the castle the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Princess now spoke. &#8220;Mr. Morton,&#8221; she said in English
and in a voice betokening the strain consequent
on her condition, &#8220;I know not how to thank you.
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, say no more,&#8221; begged Morton.</p>

<p>Helène could not speak. The tension had been almost
more than she could bear. She found relief, however,
in laughter, an hysterical kind of laughter it
sounded to Morton&#8217;s ears. But he was glad to hear
it; it told him that he need have no further anxiety
about the girls&#8217; courage; they would measure up to
what was still before them.</p>

<p>The wagon came to a halt and John stepped out,
carefully closing the canvas flaps behind him. He
returned soon, however, and informed the girls that
there was nothing the matter; he would leave them
alone now and take his seat alongside the driver, and
a man would precede the cart on horseback. In a few
minutes a brass lantern was swinging from the fore
peak of the canvas hood, its grateful light spreading a
pleasant warmth into the interior of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The girls, curious as to their situation, looked about
them. At first they could make out nothing but vague
shadows, but as their eyes became accustomed to the
flickering light they saw with surprise the excellent
arrangements that had been made for their comfort.
Two strong but soft and yielding couches ran lengthwise
along the floor of the wagon, with a space between
them. In the corners were a number of downy
pillows, while from the canvas covering hung two
robes of fur.</p>

<p>Helène was delighted. &#8220;See, Princess,&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;see what a cozy place we are in.&#8221; The Princess
lay huddled, sobbing softly. &#8220;Oh, dear lady, do
not give way. Come, rest yourself on this couch.&#8221;
She lifted the girl as best she could, laid her on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of the boxes and covered her with one of the robes.
&#8220;There is nothing to be afraid of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid, dear Helène,&#8221; said the Princess,
&#8220;but the suddenness of all that has happened has
unnerved me. I&#8217;ll be quite well again soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flash of a lighted match flared in and the odor
of a cigar was wafted to them on the breeze. How
good it was to smell the fragrance. It meant a man,
and a man meant protection. The next moment Morton&#8217;s
cheery voice came through: &#8220;Make yourselves
comfortable, ladies. You&#8217;ll find everything you want.
Take my advice and get a sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène thanked him and said they would. She went
back to where the Princess lay and saw with satisfaction
that she was sleeping. Without, the storm
seemed to have renewed its fury. The rain beat on
the canvas, the wheels groaned and crunched, the
wagon lurched from side to side in its heavy progress,
and the swish of water poured from overhanging
trees. Helène had now grown accustomed to
these sounds. She looked at her watch and noted
with surprise that it was but just gone eight. They
had been only two hours on their journey&mdash;two hours
that had seemed to her like two days! She felt very
tired; her head ached and her limbs were cramped. She
would take Mr. Morton&#8217;s advice and rest; perhaps
she would feel better after a sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you asleep?&#8221; It was Morton whispering
loudly to her from the front seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she whispered back, &#8220;what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just wanted to tell you that you must not be
anxious if you hear noises soon; we are about to cut
the telegraph wires. In another hour we shall make
our first stop for a change of horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène thanked him for the information and lay
down. She tried her best to sleep but failed. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
heard the driver halt his horses and distinguished
Morton&#8217;s voice giving orders. Then she heard the
clinking of steel implements and the sound of branches
snapping. They must be cutting the wires, she
thought. A few minutes later she heard Donald call
out: &#8220;All&#8217;s finished, Mr. Morton,&#8221; and the journey
was resumed.</p>

<p>And now she knew that they were ascending, for
she felt the straining of the horses in the creaking
harness, and counted deliberately the squelching of
their feet in the muddy track. It had grown quite cold,
and the fragrance of spruce and hemlock came to her.
She lay on the couch looking up at the swaying lantern,
half dozing, half waking.</p>

<p>As in a dream she heard Morton speaking to Papiu
and Donald: &#8220;It is snowing. We certainly are in luck.
It&#8217;ll cover up all our tracks. Say, Don, isn&#8217;t it good
to feel the snow again? We haven&#8217;t seen any in
three years, have we?&#8221; And Donald&#8217;s hearty laugh
came back in response. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t much of a snowfall,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but if things work anyway like they do at
home, I guess we&#8217;re in for a good blizzard.&#8221;</p>

<p>She cuddled herself closer in the fur robe and felt
happy in its comforting warmth. How long she lay
there thus she did not know, but she rose up suddenly
and looked about her in wide-eyed surprise. The
wagon had come to a halt, and she heard the flaps at
the rear of the vehicle being drawn aside. The Princess,
too, had been aroused, and she, too, was staring
with frightened eyes about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are, ladies,&#8221; came the cheery voice of
Morton. He was standing outside, a lantern swinging
from his arm. &#8220;Our first stopping place. You
may come out now.&#8221; He assisted them in gallant
style out of the wagon and led them to a wood-built
shack. &#8220;Welcome!&#8221; he cried, laughing. They entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and found themselves in a low roughly built
room in the center of which stood a table made of
boards and by its side a crude bench.</p>

<p>Placing his lantern on the table he bade them be
seated. He would bring them some food. Helène
and the Princess looked about the place and shivered
beneath their furs. It was cheerless and bare enough
to satisfy the most fanatic of hermits. The yellow
light from the lantern filled the distant parts of it
with unearthly shadows. The two girls instinctively
moved closer to each other.</p>

<p>John returned almost immediately carrying a promising
looking basket from which he took out some
snow-white napkins, a goodly supply of sandwiches,
oranges, cakes, tin cups, a flask of wine and a carafe
of water.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, ladies, is a feast for the gods, or, I should
say, for the goddesses. Eat heartily because you will
need all your strength. I will leave you now to yourselves.
I shall be back in half an hour. Have no
anxiety.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls were hungry, and the food and drink
were very welcome. Their appetite satisfied they felt
both strengthened and cheered. Donald came in
and introduced himself by addressing the peaked roof.
They smiled and nodded kindly at him. He busied
himself removing quickly the remains of the dinner
and disappeared.</p>

<p>The Princess was smiling happily now. &#8220;Dear
Helène,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was very wrong. I ought to
have known that you knew best. Please forgive me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène pressed her friend&#8217;s hand with happy tears
in her eyes. &#8220;The Holy Virgin,&#8221; she said, &#8220;will protect
us, and Mr. Morton is a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Punctual to the minute John came in and found
them ready to continue their journey. Helping them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
into their place of refuge, he carefully closed the rear
flaps and resumed his seat by the side of Papiu. Once
more the cart took up its rumbling and the wheels
their crunching. The road was hilly, and the four
horses strained and pulled, urged on by the driver
and a man who sat astride one of the leaders. The
girls lay comfortably covered and snugly embedded on
their couches, but the steep incline caused them to slip
occasionally, and once Helène came to the floor of the
wagon with a thud. Morton called in that they should
put up the boards they would find near the end of their
couches and brace their feet against it. Helène carried
out his instructions, and could not help wondering
at Morton&#8217;s forethought. He had thought of everything.
He might be in the business of rescuing girls
in distress.</p>

<p>Their progress now was much slower than it had
been so far&mdash;the climb was becoming steeper and
steeper. Soon the squeaking of the wheels ceased
and the wagon swayed no more&mdash;they had come to a
smoother road. The wind had almost gone down entirely;
but the sound of swaying trees, the crisp swish
of evergreen branches against the sides of the cart,
the whisper of the woods, came to them in softened
drones and murmurs and soothed them drowsily.
Soon both were asleep.</p>

<p>Morton, in front, puffed silently at his cigar, perfectly
happy and deeply thankful for the success which
so far had followed him in this undertaking. It had
been a day of no little anxiety; for, in spite of the
cheerfulness he assumed before the girls, he had had,
it must be confessed, many qualms. The Princess
was an unknown quantity to him, and he did not
know but that she might be difficult to manage. His
hope lay in the Comtesse&mdash;in Helène&mdash;he dwelt lovingly
on its syllables as he murmured the name softly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
She was a great girl, he kept saying to himself&mdash;a
great girl. What lovely eyes she had! And her
smile&mdash;Ah! her smile&mdash;it was like golden sunshine
after rain. He puffed at his cigar and found it had
gone out.</p>

<p>Then the rider on the leader gave a loud grunt,
and Donald&#8217;s voice came to him, calling out, &#8220;Whoa,
boys, Whoa!&#8221;</p>

<p>Papiu had reigned in his horses, and the cart came
to a full step with a shock.</p>

<p>Helène awoke with a start. She heard the horses
shaking their bits and the men hurrying about as they
undid their harness. Then Morton came in and said:
&#8220;Time to get up, ladies. We have arrived at our own
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose quickly and gently woke her companion.
The Princess rubbed her eyes and inquired what was
the matter. Helène told her what Morton had said.
In a minute both were ready and Morton assisted them
to alight.</p>

<p>They were before a low, roughly built hutlike
building, under snow-covered trees, the drooping
branches of which swept the roof-planks, which were
glittering in a crystalline snow-mantle. A couple of
lanterns hung from the eaves over the entrance to the
hut and lit up the strange scene. Opposite this structure
stood a loftier building. The lantern on a bench
showed a narrow porch with a low door leading into
a lighted room. Boards on the wet snow were
placed as a foot-walk, and over these the two girls
were led by Morton into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome home!&#8221; he said gaily, his eyes laughing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">HELÈNE awoke the next morning wild-eyed
and distraught. She had had a most frightening
dream. She had dreamed that she was
bound and enveloped in a coarse rug, carried like the
captive of some barbarian soldiery. Two terrible
looking men in shaggy furs and great turbans were
taking her down a narrow winding step-way hewn in
a steep rock. She saw the slimy walls dripping with
water and felt the heavy, damp air weighing on her
chest so that she could scarcely breathe. She tried
to scream in her terror. She heard the roaring of
the surf beating against a door into which she realized
she would soon be carried a prisoner. She must act
at once&mdash;cry aloud for help. Straining at the thongs
that bound her cruelly she gave a groan. It was then
she awoke.</p>

<p>Her throat felt dry and almost parched. Trembling
in every limb, she passed her hands over her face
and took courage to look about her. Her eyes caught
a purplish color against yellow boards; irregular
cracks and knot holes let in faint streaks of light.
Where was she? She pushed aside a heavy braid of
hair that had fallen across her face and tried to collect
herself. A grating noise from without drew her
attention to the wall, where she saw a partly opened
broad low window across which floated a purple scarf.
Gradually she remembered. One by one the events
of the past hours came back to her. She recalled the
last words the young American had addressed to her.
He had asked her to leave the window open, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
remembered carrying out his suggestion to put something
over the opening so as to keep out the morning&#8217;s
light. He had left her a lamp and a clock. Yes, the
lamp was still there, its pale yellow flame flickering
feebly now. The clock also was by the bedside ticking
quickly. Its &#8220;tick-tock, tick-tock,&#8221; somehow comforted
her; there was a human quality in the almost impudent
carelessness with which it was doing its business&mdash;so
regardless of her own feelings. How silly of her
to be frightened by a dream!</p>

<p>By her side lay the Princess, her face and hair almost
pansy-tinted in the light that filtered through the improvised
purple-colored scarf-curtain. She was breathing
regularly in a sleep that would be strengthening
in its refreshing rest. And then came thoughts of the
dangers yet to be endured and overcome. Would they
once again be free and happy? Would it be granted
to them to see their loved ones again? The questions
brought a longing hope shot through with pain. But
come what may she would play her part as her father
would have wished her to play it.</p>

<p>Stepping out of bed so as not to arouse her companion,
she dressed herself in the rough peasant&#8217;s
costume she had worn the day before, and crept on
tip-toe to the window.</p>

<p>Pushing aside the scarf, she leaned out to inhale the
cool, balmy air. But the sight that met her eyes made
her start back. Surely this was fairyland! Through
majestic tree trunks and spreading boughs of noble
firs, shafts of sunlight shot down on an earth white
with snow. In the golden light the crystals shone and
glittered again. The light wind blew the flakes and
showered them abroad so that they seemed like floating
diamonds as they dropped noiselessly to the ground.
High up through the branches she caught a vista of a
deep-blue sky, crossed and recrossed by the gleaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
white bars of branches and making a pattern of lace
work as intricate as it was wonderful. She felt as if
she had been transported by some genii into a palace
of snow and stalactites. And through it all&mdash;through
this indescribable maze of virgin whiteness&mdash;floated
and vibrated a bluish haze, an azure atmosphere that
seemed as if it could be felt&mdash;pulsating light and living
shadows playing a bewildering dance. Helène
could scarcely breathe, so entranced was she. She
leaned over the window-sill and watched the downy
snow as it fell, released from its hold on the branches
under the redeeming influence of sunlight. The blood
coursed rapidly through her veins; her heart quickened
and a new courage and hope came to her. She
forgot her anxiety, she forgot the dangers, she thought
of nothing but fairies and flowers and the sweet
visions of her childhood. She was all compounded of
wonder and worship, and happy, happy, happy!</p>

<p>A clear shrill whistle, the intimate call of a bird,
drew her attention to the mysterious depths of the
lower foliage. A little crossbill was hopping and flitting
back and forth; and then she remembered that it
was still autumn in the valleys below. And with this
remembrance she was brought back to the reality of
her present situation&mdash;of her escape from the palace
with the Princess; of Mr. Morton&mdash;how brave and
gentle he was! Of the terrible journey through the
storm&mdash;how kind and considerate he had been!&mdash;of
their arrival at this place&mdash;how encouraging and courteous
he had proved himself! Who and what was
this man? The little bird flew off with a whirr, and
a knock sounded on the door. Helène jumped back
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, ladies!&#8221; came Morton&#8217;s voice
through the closed door, &#8220;it is a lovely morning and
breakfast will be ready as soon as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>Ah, what a friendly sound his words carried with
them! She stepped quickly to the door and called out
heartily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Morton. I am already dressed,
and the Princess soon will be. Isn&#8217;t it glorious outside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glorious, indeed. Don&#8217;t hurry. Call out the moment
you are ready. We are just in the next room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; we shall be with you in ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened to his firm steps and heard the outer
door being closed. For a moment she stood smiling at
the wooden partition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helène, Helène, where are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned quickly and found the Princess sitting
up in bed, her hair in disorder and her great dark
eyes staring frightened at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my darling,&#8221; she cried, running up to her,
&#8220;get up and dress at once. It&#8217;s so lovely and beautiful
outside. I have just been speaking with Mr. Morton,
who came to tell us that breakfast would soon be ready.
I am so hungry that I could eat all Roumelia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where I was when I woke up,&#8221; sighed
the Princess, &#8220;and when I found you were not by my
side I got frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to be afraid of now. Mr. Morton
says we are quite safe. Come, let me be your maid
this morning,&mdash;we must put on pleasant faces if only
to show Mr. Morton that we have confidence in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, dear Helène. I am afraid I&#8217;ve been
a bit of a kill-joy. But, oh, you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ve
suffered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do know, dear Princess, and I feel for you in
all my soul. But the danger is passed now, and you
will soon be with your friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus comforting and cheering her companion Helène
helped her to dress. In a little more than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
ten minutes they were both ready, and with fresh,
smiling faces walked timidly into the adjoining
apartment.</p>

<p>They found no one there; but a table all laid out
with tablecloth, plates and eating utensils was in
the center of the room, giving it a homelike and inviting
air. Helène walked to the door, and in her
clear, ringing voice called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are ready, Mr. Morton!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly, almost, it seemed to her, John appeared,
and greeting both girls, he led them to their places
at the table. Papiu entered with a bountifully loaded
tray, and the meal was begun under his grinning waiting.
He beamed on them all as if there were no
higher duty than service. John took the occasion to
tell the girls of their present situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are quite safe here,&#8221; he assured them. &#8220;The
men and I were out at daybreak exploring the country,
and I was glad to find that the tracks of the wheels
have been quite covered up. We took the precaution,
however, to cut the telegraph wires on the other side
of the valley, so that no communication can be sent
to the border on the northwest, for which we are
bound. I am sure we have nothing further to fear.
All that it needs now is to be patient. There may
be a few difficulties; but these can easily be overcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess smiled at Morton graciously. &#8220;You
have placed us, Mr. Morton,&#8221; she said, &#8220;under a debt
of gratitude which we can never repay. I must ask
you to forgive me for my seeming lack of faith in
you; but you will, I am sure, appreciate the circumstances
of my position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Your Highness, say no more. I quite understand.
In my eagerness to help you, I forgot that
I was a total stranger to you. Count Rondell made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
it so imperative&mdash;I was not to leave you to the mercy
of the new government, at any cost. That was why
I begged your friend, the Comtesse Helène, to see you
again and do her utmost to persuade you and to inform
you of the political conditions about which you
might, perhaps, be in ignorance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were very kind and thoughtful, Mr. Morton.
I assure you I can never forget what you have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène looked delighted at the happy outcome of
this the first real meeting between her beloved Princess
and Mr. Morton. Her face was all roses and
her eyes beamed the emotions she was feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now everything will be all right, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;
she asked jocularly. They all laughed, as they rose
from the table.</p>

<p>John explained that it was necessary for him to
leave them now for an investigation as to the next stage
of their journey, but he would see that Donald and
Papiu remained behind to keep guard. He would go
with Mihai. If they liked they could sit on the porch
running along the south side of the cabin, but in that
case they must be careful to wear their fur coats. He
then shouldered his rifle and was soon seen to disappear
in the close timber.</p>

<p>Helène and the Princess, only too eager to enjoy
the freedom of the open air, put on their coats and
sat sunning themselves under the sheltering wing of
the house, drinking in the pine-laden air and filling
their souls with the silent, imposing beauty of the
forest-clad mountains. What a change from the
rooms in the castle! Surely nature was kinder than
man! She gave so freely of her bounteous treasures
and asked nothing in return&mdash;nothing but the heart
to feel and the spirit to enjoy her gifts. Helène
looked at her companion and saw that her face had
become clouded again. With a quick movement she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
drew close to her and put her arms about her, and
thus they sat for many minutes in silent sympathy
with each other. Nature is kind, but she is sadness-breeding
even in her most generous moods, and it is
then that the heart sends out its tendrils feeling for
another heart. Perhaps that is why people are happier
and simpler in the country than they are in the
city.</p>

<p>Their meditations were disturbed by the sound of
footfalls on the mushy snow. It was Donald emerging
from the wood, rifle under his arm.</p>

<p>The girls greeted him smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine morning, ladies, but kind o&#8217; mean under-foot,&#8221;
and he smiled a little sheepishly as he stood
before them. They relieved him of his shyness by
encouraging nods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything I can do for you? Mr. Morton
told me to look after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, thank you,&#8221; replied Helène; &#8220;we are
quite comfortable and enjoying the splendid air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both, however, were hoping he would not go away.
They longed for some companionship rather than
their own&mdash;some other human being who would
speak to them and tell them things&mdash;anything. Helène
caught the Princess&#8217;s eyes and saw the same desire
in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. McCormick, won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;
she asked in her soft, seductive voice. &#8220;Sit down and
talk to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, miss, I don&#8217;t mind if I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Donald&#8217;s social instincts, like those of all true Americans,
were very strong in him. Moreover, he had not
had many opportunities of exercising his English-speaking
tongue since he had left Brindisi. His intercourse
with Papiu and Mihai had been in the deaf
and dumb language, mostly. Laying aside his rifle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
he brought out a roughly made stool, and sitting down,
cap in hand, faced the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it does a fellow like me good to see your sweet
faces, ladies. And how did you like my breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course it was delicious. So was he, they thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, miss, that&#8217;s awful kind of you. But I
would have done better if I&#8217;d had some time and
things, and less strictness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strictness? What does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, miss, I wasn&#8217;t allowed to build a fire until
the sun was way up. Mr. Morton didn&#8217;t want no
smoke about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friend is a very cautious man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend? Oh, I see, you mean Mr. Morton.
Well, he&#8217;s a friend all right, and a very good one;
but he&#8217;s really my boss, you know&mdash;my master, I
guess you&#8217;d call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I thought you were comrades.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, bless your pretty eyes, miss, we&#8217;ve been pals
and comrades many a year and in many a land; but
as I get paid for my part of it, I guess it&#8217;s a job with
me. With Mr. Morton, it&#8217;s sport and study. A
mighty good sport he is, and a fine student, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don was warming up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You interest us greatly&mdash;please go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Donald&#8217;s leathery face creased itself into numerous
wrinkles as he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t much to tell, I guess. I&#8217;ve known Mr.
John ever since he was a boy of ten or twelve, and
a finer youngster never lived. His father, old Dan
Morton, used to come every summer to the Upper
Lakes for the fishin&#8217;, and when the boy got old enough
to travel he took him along. In those days, I used to
work as a guide in summer and fall and did loggin&#8217;
in winter and spring. After the great catch of 1874,
the old gentleman had me for guide regularly; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
when young John started to come up alone, I always
rowed and cooked for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don paused for a moment; mechanically, his
hand slipped into a side pocket of his coat to reappear
with a pipe in it. He glanced at it, then recollecting
himself, he quickly put it back. The Princess smiled:
&#8220;Please, Mr. McCormick, don&#8217;t deprive yourself.
Light your pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don looked queerly dubious and hesitated. &#8220;You
are very kind, but I&#8217;m afraid my tobacco ain&#8217;t a
cigar.&#8221; The girls laughed and assured him they
would enjoy the aroma. Don nodded and lit up; but
as he puffed he was careful to blow the smoke so that
the wind would carry it away from where the girls
were sitting. These girls were all right, he said to
himself&mdash;nice and pretty and considerate. He began
to feel quite at home with them. Puffing serenely he
took up his narrative with added zest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. John wasn&#8217;t very strong as a youngster; he
had some fever when a baby that left him kind o&#8217;
delicate. But he was fearless, quick and mighty
steady. After a couple o&#8217; years he started to pick up&mdash;and
now&mdash;there ain&#8217;t a logger in Minnesoty that
can beat him in rowing or wrestling or at huntin&#8217;. I
took to him from the start, and I love him as I would
if he were my own son. The Lord don&#8217;t make &#8217;em
any better than John Morton&mdash;let me tell ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fine of you to say so, Mr. McCormick,&#8221; said
Helène; &#8220;and I&#8217;ve no doubt Mr. Morton thinks very
highly of you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he does. He took me to the city, gave
me all kinds of chances; but somehow or other I never
could cotton to straight town life. Always wanted to
go back to the woods and the water&mdash;I am satisfied
to end my days there.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause for a few more puffs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>&#8220;Well, about two years ago, Mr. Morton comes up
to his camp pretty late in the season and wants me
to go huntin&#8217; and fishin&#8217; with him. It was kind o&#8217;
late for fish, and Mr. John is a queer hunter, he is.
He would just watch the game, follow them up, maybe&mdash;but
shoot? You can&#8217;t get him to kill anything.
He has all the trophies he wanted, he said&mdash;and as
long as we had grub there wasn&#8217;t no need of killing
God&#8217;s creatures.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was quieter than usual, and he says to me that
he wants me to go with him to Africa&mdash;doing some
exploration work, some observing&mdash;and says he,
&#8216;Don,&#8217; he says, &#8216;you come with me and we&#8217;ll have a
good time; you&#8217;ll learn some new things, see new
kinds o&#8217; game, and get fine experience; and I can do
something I wanted to try for years.&#8217; It was kind o&#8217;
sudden like, but I agreed. And so, the week after
Christmas we went to London and Paris and from
there to Egypt&mdash;and there we stuck out for nigh on
twenty months. I ain&#8217;t seen snow in two years&mdash;&#8217;most
forgot how real cold feels&mdash;and I&#8217;m mighty
glad to get a taste of both once more! And to
think that some ten days or so ago I was in the hottest
part of the world&mdash;now, would you believe
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was that, Mr. McCormick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless your pretty face, Miss, in Egypt and
the Red Sea. Hot?&mdash;two minutes of that climate,
and there wouldn&#8217;t be a trace o&#8217; this snow left!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène could barely suppress showing her keen interest.
Now, perhaps, would come what she had been
longing to know. &#8220;And was it in Egypt that you
met my father? Did Mr. Morton know my father
very long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about that, Miss; Mr. John
didn&#8217;t tell me much.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>&#8220;Then you and Mr. Morton&mdash;you are not officers
or soldiers in our&mdash;the Roumelian Army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless your hearts, miss, so far as I am concerned,
I didn&#8217;t know such a place as Roumelia was
on the map ten days ago; and it&#8217;s very little more that
I know now! Mr. John, he came to me the night we
got to Suez, saying I should get ready to take the midnight
train, go to Brindisi and act under written
orders&mdash;and I went. From there I took a train to
Kronstadt; and four days ago I drove the teams
down to Padina with the dagoes&mdash;that&#8217;s all I know.
When Mr. Morton gives you orders you ain&#8217;t askin&#8217;
no useless questions, I guess. He knows what he
wants&mdash;and you are supposed to go ahead and do
what you&#8217;re told. But you needn&#8217;t worry, young
ladies, there ain&#8217;t no better man living than Mr. John&mdash;and
few have as level a head as he&#8217;s got!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a great admirer of your master, Mr.
McCormick,&#8221; remarked the Princess, who till now
had sat very quietly, quite willing to leave the conversation
to her friend. It took her some time to
become accustomed to the peculiar drawl of the lanky
foreigner; but when once she caught the quaint humor
of the man she enjoyed him greatly. She wondered
also at the simple directness of his manner, which was
deferential without being in the least subservient.
This must be due to the democratic spirit of his
country.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s admiration, young lady, but I
have learned that Mr. Morton knows what&#8217;s right.
There isn&#8217;t a man anywheres that can teach him
much! You can build on him and never get left. If
he says a thing&mdash;it&#8217;s so; and if he stands up for you
you&#8217;re all right. And then, he ain&#8217;t putting the load on
the other fellow, either! When it comes to hard
knocks, he takes his share&mdash;and takes it without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
murmur. He is square, is Mr, John&mdash;and white all
through! You can bet on that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;White all through? What does that mean,
please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means, miss, that he is good and true and fair
all over. Not a yellow streak in him! Why, out in
the desert&mdash;the niggers and them Arabs&mdash;they found
it out quick enough&mdash;and Mr. Morton, he had the
run of the country and their good-will pretty soon
after we got settled there and they had a chance to
see what kind of a man he was! After we had a little
ruction with them once&mdash;why, after that, they
would eat out of our hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat out of your hands?&#8221;&mdash;The Princess&#8217;s eyes were
big with inquiry.</p>

<p>Helène gave a little laugh&mdash;equally at loss. &#8220;Now,
Mr. McCormick, please tell us what that means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I guess my talk ain&#8217;t just the easiest for you
to get on to. I always forget that not all people come
from America. Why, after these natives found
out we were square, that Mr. John wasn&#8217;t afraid of
them or anyone else, for that matter, that he wouldn&#8217;t
stand for any crooked deal&mdash;why, they were just
good&mdash;that&#8217;s all! I remember it as if it was yesterday;
out there in the Soudan&mdash;a God-forsaken country
that I can&#8217;t see why people will insist on living in&mdash;when
Mr. Morton got to investigate our store tent
one mornin&#8217;&mdash;he found a tripod and some instruments
missin&#8217;. We looked &#8217;round, found tracks in the dust
and sand proving that some barefooted rascals had
stole in over night. Mr. Morton, he just throws his
rifle over his shoulder, says, &#8216;Come along, Don, we
must see about this.&#8217; Well, we got our Arab driver
to bring the horses and rode over across the valley
to a camp of Wadi-Arabs we know&#8217;d were stoppin&#8217;
there. Mr. John rides up and asks for the Chief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
And when this feller&mdash;a fine-looking old chap with
whiskers like Moses&mdash;comes up&mdash;&#8216;Can I talk to all
o&#8217; your people for about five minutes?&#8217; says he. The
Chief just stares, asks Achmed&mdash;that&#8217;s our servant&mdash;a
thing or two&mdash;and then gives a call like a foghorn.
Out come a crowd o&#8217; men, big and small, old and
young, and they all lined up behind him without sayin&#8217;
a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then John Morton asks them to step up to the
hollow into the shade of the rock&mdash;it was gittin&#8217;
mighty hot by that time&mdash;he just stands up on a
boulder, leans on his rifle not caring any more than
if he were in Euclid Park&mdash;in Cleveland, you know&mdash;and
he says to the Chief: &#8216;I&#8217;ll say what I got to say
in English, and I want you to translate it to your people.&#8217;
And the old man nods and grunts somethin&#8217;, an&#8217;
my boss&mdash;he goes on. And he tells &#8217;em all right! &#8216;I
have come here a stranger,&#8217; says he, &#8216;to be a neighbor
to you; I am peaceful. I don&#8217;t bother about you and
I mind my own business. Now I want you to do to
me as I am doin&#8217; to you! Somebody, last night, took
my tools and instruments, and I need them in my work&mdash;and
I want &#8217;em back! If any of you men is in need&mdash;you
can come to me and if I can help ye&mdash;I will! If
you need food&mdash;I&#8217;ll share mine with you. If you are
in trouble and I know a way out&mdash;you can have my
assistance. But I won&#8217;t allow any man to steal my
things, and I am a feller you want to leave alone. I
never wronged anybody&mdash;but neither will I permit any
man living to do a wrong to me.&#8217;&mdash;Then he motions
to the Chief and the old man he translates it to his
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don stopped out of sheer breathlessness; his enthusiasm
had carried him at a rapid pace, while the girls,
fascinated, bent over, devouring every word. He
paused long enough to relight his pipe and send out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
a few mouthfuls of his beloved golden-leaf smoke.
Its pungent odor came to the girls&#8217; nostrils and added
to the reality of the mental pictures they had built out
of his narrative.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have seen him&mdash;standin&#8217; there among
those savage people, alone against a hundred&mdash;but as
steady as a rock and as cool as a cucumber! Not an
eyelash did he move! I wasn&#8217;t sure what would come
next&mdash;but I guess Mr. Morton, he knew. He looked
fine! I wish his father could ha&#8217; seen him! The old
man always was proud of his boy&mdash;as he had a right
to be. He used to say to me: &#8216;Don, I want my boy
to be a man first and a gentleman after!&#8217; And I guess
Mr. John is both, and both to the limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and gave a reminiscent stare into the
infinite space above him. A few thoughtful pulls at
the pipe followed by a copious discharge of saliva and
he proceeded with his tale:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;after the Chief had finished, two young
fellers just drawed their burnooses a bit tighter over
their faces and sneaked off. A minute later they
brought the instruments, laid them down before Mr.
John, and, walking with their heads bent in shame,
they passed before the Chief. The old priest he just
looked dark and grieved and waved them off without
a word. Then he up and walks to John, hands him
bread and salt and says: &#8216;Noble stranger, my people
and me are humbled by your just complaint. Hereafter
you needn&#8217;t lose sleep over my men; none of
&#8217;em will ever wrong you again, none of my people will
do anything toward you that he don&#8217;t want you to do
toward us. If we can do anything to please you&mdash;say
the word&mdash;we are your slaves. And Mr. John&mdash;he
took the bread and salt. Then we mounted the horses
and rode home. Our servant, he carried the instruments
and after that&mdash;none of them fellers came within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a big spell of our camp! Those Arabs know a man
when they see him pretty damn quick, I guess!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>He shifted uneasily in his seat and shut his mouth
tight. In his excitement he had forgotten he was
speaking to ladies. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;m talking too much.
I must apologize. But you&#8217;ve been so interested that
I couldn&#8217;t help myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls assured him that they had enjoyed his
story extremely and begged him to tell them some
more of his interesting adventures. But Don was too
cautious now to be caught a second time.</p>

<p>Morton now appeared, followed by Mihai. He
looked up at the porch and took the situation in at
a glance. Don approached his master looking as if he
had been caught, like a child in a naughty act. A few
whispered words passed between them, and Don
walked off without even giving the girls a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose Donald has been chattering,&#8221; remarked
Morton as he stepped on to the porch, &#8220;he&#8217;s a great
yarn-spinner and doesn&#8217;t know when to stop. I hope
he has not bored you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;not at all! He was telling us some of the
incidents of your life in the desert&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Helène was
attempting to shield the fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;A-h&mdash;then I guess he&#8217;s been sounding my praises.
But you must not believe everything he says. He&#8217;s a
true Yankee, and knows how to drag the long bow.
Have you rested?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both the girls assured him that they had and that
Mr. McCormick had entertained them immensely.
Morton smiled, and excusing himself, left them to
themselves. The Princess, however, was tired; the
bracing air had made her drowsy. She begged Helène
to remain while she lay down in her room.</p>

<p>Morton was really disturbed about Don&#8217;s chatter;
he was afraid he might have spoken of Count Rondell&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
illness. He would find out, and warn the man
to say nothing about that matter to the Comtesse.</p>

<p>Helène sat for a long time thinking over what she
had learned from Don&#8217;s narrative. Instead of clearing
up the situation it had only aroused in her more
questionings. She could not explain Mr. Morton&#8217;s presence
in Roumelia. Why had he undertaken this mission?
It was true that her father had written begging
her to place implicit confidence in him&mdash;but why
this man, this American of all men? Even if it were
dangerous for him to come himself, could he not have
sent one of his own friends? It was more than she
could understand. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;she was glad
it had been this man. He was so different from the
men she had met. He came from a country where
there were neither kings nor nobles and yet, he knew
how to command and be obeyed. His father wanted
him to be a man first&mdash;yes, he was that&mdash;the equal
to the best she had known. She felt herself blushing
at her thoughts. No, no, no, she must not let herself
think like this. Rising suddenly she crossed the open
space before the cabin, and with quickened steps passed
under the firs, to where a rushing stream was frothing
its way down a deep gorge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">HER back against the protecting trunk of an
ancient hemlock, whose exposed gnarled roots
gave a good foothold and a secure seat, Helène
sat curled up with her feet tucked under her warm skirt.
She was watching intently the turbulent waters hurrying
in the direction that meant freedom and safety
to her, the Princess&mdash;and to their escort also. The
child in her felt the longing for refuge, the desire to
flee from the land that had denied her, but that was
yet her own land. The woman in her, the existence
of which the girl did not suspect, mingled with these
fears and desires the mysterious feeling of having
found a man who would, with strong arm, come between
her and danger.</p>

<p>Helène had never been in so wild a country. She
had never been alone in the woods, and the peacefulness
of her surroundings, the grandeur of it all, impressed
her deeply. Her situation seemed so unreal,
as though it were almost impossible to believe in its
fact. Was she little Snow-White with the Seven
Dwarfs across the Seven Hills? Was she like Saint
Elizabeth driven into the wild forests by her jealous
spouse? It seemed as if some gnomes or fairies were
peeking out from under the tumbled chaos of roots and
boulders; as if every little heap of dried pine needles
were the seat of some good little goblin. No, it really
was true; here she was sitting watching the cataracts
of an unknown mountain stream tumbling and gamboling
down hill, dressed in peasant&#8217;s garments, with
hobnailed shoes on her feet, provided by a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
man speaking a foreign tongue, from some most unknown
part of a distant world, and yet, strange to say,
she was quite happy! Would anyone ever believe her
if she told the tale? Stowed in a wagon equipped
like a gipsy&#8217;s caravan, in the dark storm and driving
rain, dreading discovery every instant! And the arrival
at the hidden house under the whispering trees,
still under the calm protection of a strange man who
provided everything and seemed to rule even the elements.
It was all so wonderful! And how good and
brave he was!</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Helène, may I sit and talk to you?&#8221; Her face
turned scarlet as if he had heard her thoughts. She
stammered and attempted to rise. &#8220;Pray, don&#8217;t disturb
yourself, Miss Helène. You have selected a
charming spot, and if you will permit me, I&#8217;ll join you
in your retreat. But first take this robe; the air is
damp here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton came up to her with steady, quick steps.
Helène scarcely dared to look.</p>

<p>A soft rug was laid across her lap, and John stood
beside her. &#8220;Is it not fascinating to watch a mountain
stream straining and speeding towards its future? I
love it, and it is so long since I have been near one.
A glorious day, Miss Helène, and all the elements in
our favor. May I sit down?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène looked up. &#8220;Certainly, Mr. Morton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her gaze sank again and rested on her shoes. How
clumsy the boots were! Looking up she met John&#8217;s
questioning eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad your feet are resting on a dry spot, Miss
Helène; you must guard yourself against catching
cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not over cautious, Mr. Morton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly, but you know I have just come from a
country where it never rains, where it is always hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and dry, and it may be I am worrying about the effects
of dampness more than the people here would do. It
seems a crime to ask you to wear those heavy boots,
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Morton, I don&#8217;t mind them at all. You
are very kind and thoughtful. We are under a deep
obligation to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please forget the obligation. Just be brave and
help the Prin&mdash; I mean Miss Marie, to keep her courage,
and we shall soon be out of this forsaken land.
May I adjust your rug? Ah&mdash;now you are snug and
comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. It is delightful to sit here and watch
the brook. Isn&#8217;t the contrast between the pure white
on the ground and the deep green of the trees striking?&#8221;</p>

<p>John assented. &#8220;This is as beautiful a spot of mountain
scenery as I have ever seen. The Carpathians
are far wilder than I imagined. I have never been in
these Eastern sections of Europe. This fine Alpine
landscape equals that of Switzerland and the Tyrol.
Do you know this country well, Miss Helène?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very well. Three years ago my father took
me to Kimpola at the foot of the Negoi, our highest
peak, you know. The mountains there are covered
with snow and ice all the year round; the slopes are
very steep and rocky, devoid of all vegetation. It is
far more attractive here.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed providential that he had come at this time;
her doubts could be satisfied&mdash;why not take courage
and ask him to explain?</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton&mdash;may I ask you some questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to look unconcerned though inwardly she
was greatly agitated. Would he resent her presumption?</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Helène, I am quite at your service.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
On his open countenance she could not read the mental
reservation he had registered in his thoughts; she
might ask, but he would tell her only what was good
for her to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;First, then, allow me to apologize for my rudeness
to you upon our second interview. I&mdash;I was very
much agitated and&mdash;I felt humiliated that a stranger
had been sent to us to succor the Princess. Even now
I cannot understand why one of our own cavaliers had
not come forward on behalf of his monarch&#8217;s niece.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the pause that ensued a deep frown puckered the
young man&#8217;s brow. Helène continued: &#8220;I am in the
dark as to what happened at the Capital, but our army
and our court boasted of many a noble devoted to their
King; I&mdash;I do not know what to think, what to say!&mdash;Mr.
Morton&mdash;I hope you are not offended at my foolish
questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>John looked at her steadily with eyes serious, his
face alight with sympathy. &#8220;Pray, Miss Helène, do not
disturb yourself about feelings; but take my advice
and let well enough alone! It might be better not to
inquire too curiously. What need you care what happened
at the Capital, or what motives have prompted
the inaction of your Roumelian cavaliers? Be brave
and patient&mdash;and when we are once across the border
line&mdash;why&mdash;you may ask all the questions you like.
Think now only of Transylvania and safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton&mdash;how long have you known my
father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not known the General very long, but I have
known him long enough to have obtained his confidence.
Evidently, I was the most available man for
the job&mdash;I mean the plan, and&mdash;here I am. Are you
dissatisfied with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène colored deeply, raising her hand almost as
if in supplication. &#8220;Oh, Mr. Morton&mdash;please! You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
have been so kind, so considerate, that I scarcely know
what to say. The Princess feels as I do. But she also
feels so forlorn, so abandoned by her own people that
she can only wonder how you came to be our protector.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse&mdash;pardon the slip&mdash;Miss Helène, please do
not dwell on that. Of the affairs of Roumelia and the
Count I know but little. I am here but for one
purpose, and we are well on the way towards its
accomplishment. Nothing else matters. You may
recall, however, I have never claimed any allegiance
to the cause of royalty. All that has been and still
is on my mind is your safety and that of the Princess&mdash;&#8221;
He broke off with an assumption of impatience.
&#8220;Your father, dear lady, felt it was his duty
to do all he could to protect Miss Marie&mdash;of course,
you were in his thoughts also. It has been my happiness
to be of service to the Count. Please, Miss
Helène, do not live in the past, but look ahead! The
world is beautiful, you are young. All happiness is
before you. In a few days you will have forgotten
these dark weeks. You will then be restored to your
father. Tell me now about yourself, Miss Helène.
What kind of a life does a lady of a court, a petted
and admired Comtesse, lead?&#8221;</p>

<p>His assumed lightness of manner deceived the unsophisticated
girl. Youth does not dwell on misfortunes
forever&mdash;it is more comfortable to be irresponsible!
Her frown disappeared. How delightfully
naïve this foreigner was!</p>

<p>&#8220;There is very little to tell, Mr. Morton. Until six
years ago I have lived at home with my dear parents&mdash;very
quietly&mdash;studying languages, a little art and
music. When my dear mama died&mdash;after a dark and
lonely six months&mdash;papa sent me to the &#8216;Seurs de
Sacre Coeur&#8217; in Gratz. Last year he called for me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
I joined him in Bucharest. When Princess Marie and
her court left for their annual stay at the Summer
Castle in Padina&mdash;her Majesty the Queen proposed
that I should join the Princess. I think father worried
about my being left alone, but it seemed to be the
best arrangement for both of us. I have really never
been at the Court itself; indeed, I have not yet been
presented!&#8221; Her eyes danced with fun. &#8220;This frock
would look fine for my <i>début</i>&mdash;would it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose, shook herself free from the folds of the
rug and gave him a deep courtesy, mischief and laughter
in her eyes, as she murmured: &#8220;Your Highness&mdash;Your
obedient servant!&#8221;</p>

<p>John, entered into the spirit of the rekindled happy
moment, and holding out his hand to the charming
maiden, bowed low and murmured back: &#8220;Your slave,
my lady.&#8221; Both laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Helène was the first to recover herself. She glanced
at the fine frank face before her, and recalling her neglect
of her companion, exclaimed, with somewhat
heightened color: &#8220;I must see if the Princess requires
my presence! Permit me to go into the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please stay. Before I came here Miss Marie told
me that she would lie down and rest. She is probably
asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not afraid I shall catch cold, Mr. Morton?&#8221;
Helène asked roguishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you are teasing, Miss Helène!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Mr. Morton. No, you have been more
than kind. I can never thank you sufficiently. The
Princess and I must be a great anxiety to you. I shall
tell my father how good you were. Shall we return
to our old observatory?&#8221;</p>

<p>All shyness and timidity had now left the young girl.
She was safe with this strange American. His quiet
strength inspired confidence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>Resuming her seat, she snugly wrapped herself up
and abandoned herself to the charm of the view. The
warmth of the sun sent her blood coursing freely
through her veins, and she gave a free rein to the
happiness of the moment. Without realizing it, her
protector meant more to her than she would have dared
to admit to herself. Certainly he was good to look
upon. His eyes were so frank and gentle and they
looked at her with such protecting glances, in their expression.
He was telling her now of his travels and
his home life. He spoke warmly of his father and
with devotion of his mother. He seemed glad of the
opportunity to speak of his people.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Miss Helène, I have a little sister at
home, about your age&mdash;a jolly, fine girl; you would
like her, I am sure. And my mother&mdash;you would love
her&mdash;everybody does. She is tall and very handsome,
with the loveliest gray hair, and the face of a young
girl. I wish you could meet my people some day.
You would like them, I think. And father, oh, he&#8217;s a
splendid fellow. He is the kind of man who is everybody&#8217;s
friend. He&#8217;d adopt you as his own, five minutes
after he saw you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Comtesse laughed heartily. &#8220;But your sister&mdash;how
old is she and what is her name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth is just twenty; she is named after her aunt,
my mother&#8217;s sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a beautiful name&mdash;Ruth! I have heard that
your country loves the Bible names. Is she fair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Ruth is quite a brunette. Father is dark&mdash;Ruth
favors him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when do you expect to see your family again,
Mr. Morton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect to be in New York toward the beginning
of December. I had some disquieting cables about
my father&#8217;s health&mdash;you know I haven&#8217;t been home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in almost two years. He isn&#8217;t old, but he has worked
hard all his life. I should have been home earlier, but&mdash;but
for some things that had turned up unexpectedly,&#8221;
he concluded rather lamely.</p>

<p>The girl grew thoughtful; she guessed to what he
referred. She began to realize what a sacrifice it had
been for him. What could she say? Dared she speak
her thoughts? With blood mantling to her cheek and
brow, she remained silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;A penny for your thoughts, Miss Helène!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no pennies in Roumelia, we call them
&#8216;banu.&#8217; And I don&#8217;t think they are worth even a
penny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take my chances on their value.&#8221;</p>

<p>Providence has endowed woman with a sixth sense
which, when called upon, forms a defensive armor of
no mean strength. Helène&#8217;s intuition told her she was
on dangerous ground, and she changed the subject of
their conversation. Mr. Morton&#8217;s eyes had been insistently
directed to her face, not for an instant had
they faltered&mdash;and the expression in them was a little
disquieting to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Morton&mdash;may I inquire what we are
to do next?&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor John! He had noticed the heightened color,
cursed himself for an imbecile that could not govern
his tongue, saw the glorious eyes covered by their
silken lashes, and perceived the embarrassment. He
took it for a hint.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men are clearing the short stretch of lane that
leads from the road to our camp here. The road itself
is in very fair state. The moon rises about midnight,
and if sufficiently light we shall start at that hour. If
very cloudy, or if it snows or rains&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t care
to travel. It wouldn&#8217;t do to light lanterns; we might
run into a patrol or something like that, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
be seen before we had warning. I have examined the
road and country with Mihai, some kilometers to the
north of us; the brothers know the country thoroughly.
Still&mdash;I would wait another day, if necessary, rather
than risk all by undue haste.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thoughtful blue eyes looked confidingly into his,
and John decided that prudence had indeed become a
virtue.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are quite safe here, Comtesse, and could remain
undetected for days. Still I hope it will be clear
to-night and that we can start. As it is, we shall have
to rest the horses about half-way. We must cover the
last stretch in the dusk or at night. Mihai, who is an
experienced woodsman, suggests that even a light
cloudiness should not prevent us from starting. You
remember, Comtesse, that the men had a little mishap
with their reserve horses, and that we have no relay
between here and the Pass; and, of course, horses are
all-important to us just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Voices from the wood drew their attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, here come the men; I had better see them at
once. Do you wish to go in, Miss Helène? At three
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; consulting his watch, &#8220;we shall call you to
dinner. Thank you for a pleasant hour, Comtesse; I
hope I haven&#8217;t bored you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I enjoyed our chat immensely&mdash;and thank you
ever so much, Mr. Morton.&#8221;</p>

<p>The afternoon meal was very much like the breakfast,
and consisted mainly of canned meats and fruits.</p>

<p>John sat with the ladies, helpful and cheerful as
always, telling tales of his life in the Soudan. It was
his business to keep them in good spirits, and he acquitted
himself admirably.</p>

<p>The sun sank lower, the shadows lengthened, the
blue of the sky deepened; there was not a cloud on the
horizon. Helène had begun to enter into the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the adventure, and felt quite proud of being in the
confidence of their leader.</p>

<p>Towards evening the packing began, and every article
was gone over with great care and deliberation.
John was everywhere, calm and quiet, seemingly seeing
everything, the men accepting his absolute authority
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>The fast sinking sun found them ready, their
work finished. Papiu went forward up the lane, taking
his place as sentinel. Donald took up his post as
watch in the wood to the north, while Mihai retired to
his quarters to sleep.</p>

<p>John approached the ladies, who had now retired
to their cozy sleeping apartment, and begging permission
came to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in good luck, ladies; we shall start shortly
after midnight. Everything is in order. Get some
sleep now, as there may not be an opportunity for
another rest for many hours. I will call you at eleven
for a little supper before we start.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls thanked him for his advice, and, after a
hearty &#8220;Good night,&#8221; John withdrew.</p>

<p>Left alone, the two girls made themselves comfortable
and settled down to sleep and rest, lying together
in close embrace. The Princess was soon fast
asleep, but Helène could not sleep. Her thoughts kept
her awake. Through her brain coursed the events that
had happened, the dangers yet before them, and the
strange circumstances in which she now found herself.
Where would she meet her father? Where would
they live? How would she find him? The Princess,
she knew, would eventually go to the Court of
Saxe-Weimar&mdash;but what would she, the daughter of
an ex-Minister, do there? She did not long for life
at Court&mdash;and what position could her father occupy
in a foreign land&mdash;himself a stranger?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>What did it mean? And what was Mr. Morton&#8217;s
relation to her father and to this affair? These questions
puzzled her again and again! She could not rest.</p>

<p>Stealthily she lowered her limbs to the floor, scarcely
disturbing the covers, and crept from the bed. Slipping
into her fur slippers&mdash;she tiptoed into the far corner
to the tiny lamp that shed a bright light upon the
diminutive table. She drew up a stool and took from
her blouse the letter from her dear father Morton had
delivered to her. She read it again slowly, studying
each sentence. No, there was nothing there of his
plans, and not a word about himself. He simply said
he could not come in person.</p>

<p>During her reading she had not noticed the chill
which pervaded the room. Now she could see her
breath as vapor against the still rays of the lamp.
Creeping back to the couch for a rug she wrapped it
around her and curled herself up on the crude parapet
of logs running along the outer wall.</p>

<p>Was her father a prisoner somewhere in a strange
land? Was he ill or&mdash;tears gathered in her burning
eyes.</p>

<p>What did it mean? And she&mdash;without a friend or a
relative in the world&mdash;without experience of the
world! She recalled the girls at the convent, and how
much more they seemed to know of life than she did;
how astonished they had been on many occasions at her
ignorance. They had dubbed her &#8220;Diana the Ingenuous.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was without clothes or money! How did people
get these things? She stared into the gloomy recesses
of the darkened room and shivered, oppressed, afraid.
The Princess could neither help her nor clear up her
doubts&mdash;the poor child knew less than she did herself.
Was ever anyone so forlorn, so abandoned?</p>

<p>Then her pride and her natural energy came to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
assistance. She must think&mdash;and she <i>could</i> not think
in this prisonlike room. She would go out, and breathe
the night air, and pray&mdash;pray for enlightenment.
&#8220;Oh, father,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;why do you not come for
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>With her rug about her she crept to the door and,
cautiously opening it, peered into the darkness of
the adjoining space. Not a sound was to be heard.
She closed the door behind her and moved swiftly
towards the exit leading into the open and stepped out
onto the porch.</p>

<p>There was light enough by which to distinguish
the outlines of beams and eaves against the bit of sky
visible above the tops of the tall trees. In the deep
shadow of the porch her eyes, now accustomed to the
doubtful light, made out the shapes of the bench and
the packages with which it was loaded. She hoped
no one would find her there. It was very cold, but she
wrapped herself in the rug, glad of its protection.</p>

<p>Through the firs came the sound of the rushing
waters of the stream in the gully; she could see the
stars and a faintly brighter spot in the heavens toward
the east. Leaning against the roughly hewn pillar in
an attempt to rest, she now began to regret her childish
flight from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; came in suppressed, but very peremptory
tones, &#8220;who is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The ever-watchful Morton stepped from the offing
towards the gully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;Mr. Morton&mdash;it is only I!&#8221; Her words came
in timid gasps. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I was restless and
unhappy, and I thought I would sit outdoors a while.
I am sorry if I have disturbed or startled you&mdash;I shall
go right in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton threw away his lighted cigar and went towards
the house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>&#8220;My dear lady, what is the matter?&#8221; With quick
steps he reached her and took a limp little hand protectingly
into his own. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t startled me. Of
course&mdash;if you could not sleep&mdash;I know how stuffy the
room is. Is the Princess asleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sound asleep, poor darling; but I couldn&#8217;t
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Miss Helène, let me arrange a seat for you
here on the porch. Sit down and rest yourself.&#8221; Suiting
his action to his words, he removed the bundles
from the bench, pulling his seat somewhat nearer to
the edge of the flooring, spread the blankets that had
covered the packages over the boards, and leading
Helène to it gently urged her to sit down, and he carefully
wrapped her in the rug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you can sit in comfort. I am sorry you must
be here in the dark, but I do not dare to light the
lanterns, and cannot give you a fire in the room&mdash;there
is no chimney. In an hour or so our supper&mdash;or rather
breakfast&mdash;will be ready and shortly after that we shall
start. Do you see that light streak over the hillside,
Comtesse? That is where our friend the moon will
appear in sixty minutes or so, and then&mdash;we shall bid
good-by to this gloomy place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Morton, you are so kind. I ought not to
add to your burden by my foolishness. Please, don&#8217;t
mind me&mdash;don&#8217;t let me keep you from your intended
work. I am making your duties only the more arduous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton gave vent to a hearty though subdued laugh.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a thing to do but to wait until the fixed
time arrives. I also couldn&#8217;t sleep. If Donald catches
me he will scold me, too. So you see, Miss Helène, we
are culprits together. It is a glorious night&mdash;it couldn&#8217;t
be better for our plans if we had ordered it. Mihai
will ride ahead. The horses are in fine form, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
daybreak we shall be fully twenty-five miles up the
road. Then, after a good rest we will start out towards
the saddle of the mountain range, and get there just in
the right time. Why, to-morrow at this hour I will
have you both in a nice cozy room at the best hotel in
Raros. The morning after you will be in a warm
coupé on the railroad, speeding on your way to your
friends! It couldn&#8217;t have gone better in the piping
times of peace!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good,&#8221; murmured the girl. His confident
cheerfulness was infectious. Fear and doubt
had vanished, and she resolved to be obedient to his
earlier request and refrain from worrying. But as to
one thing she had made up her mind&mdash;she <i>must</i> know
about her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton&mdash;why doesn&#8217;t my father write where
I am to meet him? And why didn&#8217;t he at least come
to the border?&#8221;</p>

<p>Luckily it was dark. &#8220;More trouble coming&mdash;this
young person has a mania for questioning!&#8221; Morton
reflected, but he was now thoroughly on the alert!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, did I forget to explain that? Why, the General
felt that if he were recognized anywhere near the Roumelian
line, the alarm might be given and then my
opportunity to get you two ladies away would be gone.
The only thing to do was to be bold and avoid arousing
suspicion. We were informed as to the conditions in
Padina and elsewhere&mdash;through Baron de Haas, who
wired from Constantinople, as you know. Where will
he join you? Hm&mdash;I am not certain, but I have arranged
to wire him the moment it can be done safely
and I think he expects to meet you at Weimar. He
will be there ahead of us, no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton&mdash;where did you first meet my father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On his return trip from India. We spent days in
each other&#8217;s society, and became quite intimate. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
very proud indeed to be a friend of the General, whom
I admire above all men. I deem the confidence he
has placed in me a great compliment&mdash;nay, even a noble
condescension!&#8221;</p>

<p>There are many workings of the human mind not
yet understood&mdash;a girl&#8217;s courage seems to expand in
direct ratio to the cube of her obscured sight. The
timid Helène knew she could not be observed and suspected
her informant, whom she could not see in the
darkness. She was, therefore, the more determined
to find out more of her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you met him on the steamer from India? How
was my father when you saw him last?&#8221;</p>

<p>John was quick in his answer, and took refuge in
rapid speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last time I spoke to the Count was on an evening
as lovely as this. The stars were shining just as
bright as they do now. We were discussing astronomy
and kindred subjects. The General is an unusually
well-informed man&mdash;and a delightful companion! I
asked him if he admired the much glorified Southern
Cross, sung in verse and praised in prose&mdash;and your
father surprised me by confessing that he had never
noticed it at all! Then we spoke of the stars of our
own latitudes&mdash;you know we in America see the same
heavens as you do. He was pleased when I told him
that our own &#8216;Big Dipper&#8217; was far more beautiful
than the famed southern constellation. I remember
well his remark: &#8216;Give me our own land, our own
stars, our&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Big Dipper? What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>John was delighted to find he had succeeded in turning
the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Comtesse, don&#8217;t you know the beautiful constellation
of seven big, bright stars that point to the
Polar Star? To men living in the free air of primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and thinly settled countries, it is their guide in their
travels&mdash;their compass at night. See, Miss Helène,
yonder in the north&mdash;that fine group looking like a
giant S? That&#8217;s the constellation which we Anglo-Saxons
in our practical, non-poetic way call &#8216;The
Big Dipper.&#8217; In form it looks like a pot with a crooked
handle, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we call it the &#8216;Great Bear&#8217;&mdash;it is the &#8216;Ursus
Major&#8217; of the old Romans! I&mdash;I have always loved
it. Astronomy is one of my favorite studies, Mr.
Morton.&#8221;</p>

<p>John mentally patted himself on the back; he certainly
had managed it well. He entered with renewed
enthusiasm on the subject and allowed her to instruct
him in a science the study of which had taken up many
nights of his life. Never in his life had John Morton,
the learned savant and traveler, enjoyed himself so
thoroughly. He was perfectly happy to sit at the feet
of his new teacher.</p>

<p>He turned eagerly towards Helène, and though he
could but faintly make out the outlines of her hooded
figure, he yet saw the eyes that shone intermittently
under the protecting shadow. Once more he relapsed
into the stage of adoration. He pictured to himself the
glorious eyes, the temptingly arched lips, the delicate
cheeks. His heart went out towards the lonely, forsaken
girl. He longed to take her into his arms&mdash;to
comfort and caress her. But&mdash;what was he thinking
of? He pulled himself together with a mighty
effort.</p>

<p>Helène, all unconscious of the turmoil in the breast
of her companion, leaned towards him and pointed
upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will hardly believe it, Mr. Morton, but I
don&#8217;t think I ever sat up as late as this, nor do I remember
ever having seen the sky so beautiful and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
full of stars as it is to-night. It is a most glorious
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, indeed, Miss Helène. Even I, who have lain
awake numberless nights, the entire dome and horizon
free and unobstructed above me&mdash;have never seen it
more gorgeous. For me the night skies always have
a curious charm&mdash;the lure as of a mystery&mdash;they fill
me with unknown longings. I believe I could easily
become a devotee to the worship of the starry heavens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without knowing, perhaps without even realizing it,
he had taken hold of the extended hand of the girl, and
drew it gently to himself in a light and tender grasp.
Helène was utterly unconscious of his action; she was
so happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have a strange power over me,&#8221; she whispered
rather than spoke the words. &#8220;I could sit and
look at them and forget everything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton&#8217;s voice, equally subdued, whispered back:
&#8220;Is it not your own famous Queen, the poetic and noble
&#8216;Carmen Sylva,&#8217; who says: &#8216;The night has thousands
of eyes watching its children&#8217;? There is a lovely lady!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Morton, is she not? Noble and good&mdash;and
so beautiful! Have you read her books?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them, Comtesse, and I admire them exceedingly.
But don&#8217;t forget that for more than two years
I haven&#8217;t seen a new book. During those two years
I have dreamed of happiness to come, my longings
have become crystallized&mdash;and under these stars, I
feel, my fate is being sealed&mdash;here or at some other
place&mdash;who knows? Miss Helène&mdash;for two years I
haven&#8217;t looked upon&mdash;I haven&#8217;t spoken to a woman.
Meeting you has shown me so much more clearly the
great treasure of a noble woman. Do not attribute
my words to the hour or the stars. Let me plead&mdash;plead
for myself. Permit me to tell you that from the
bottom of my heart, I am glad to have known your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
father; glad he selected me to be the bearer of his
letter; happy to be of service to you. I shall always
bless the fate that let me meet you! And when you are
back among your friends, I hope you will let me still
be your friend and grant me the opportunity to be
worthy of your friendship&mdash;your regard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rising, he lightly touched the hand he had been holding
and gently released it. Then he added: &#8220;And may
the &#8216;Big Bear&#8217; plead for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène sat motionless. Her heart was beating wildly.
His words filled her with a curious warmth as
though in response to a desired caress. She blessed
the darkness that hid the tell-tale burning in her cheeks,&mdash;she
felt she didn&#8217;t know what&mdash;she knew only that
she was happy, at peace with everything&mdash;and above
all&mdash;she was glad it was dark!</p>

<p>She rose confusedly and, to his great surprise, said
in a low voice, quite clearly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton&mdash;I have known few gentlemen other
than my father; but it has been my privilege to meet
you. I shall be proud of your friendship&mdash;any time
and anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bowed slightly, but suddenly recalling herself to
her position, she became afraid and added: &#8220;And the
unhappy Princess, I am sure, feels as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you. And now, won&#8217;t you go in and waken
Miss Marie? I see the silvery strip over the hill widening;
Mihai is scraping in the shed and breakfast
will soon be ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then to himself he whispered: &#8220;God bless you, dear
love!&#8221;&mdash;Aloud, he added: &#8220;Till breakfast, Miss
Helène!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE frowning and forbiddingly gloomy slope
of the hillside across the gorge to the East
showed clear against the sulphur streak in the
sky, when the lumbering vehicle drew up before the
porch and the order came to start.</p>

<p>Morton in short serviceable sheep furs that set off
his square shoulders and powerful chest, helped the
ladies into their wagon-recess. The horses strained
and pulled; the sled-runners squeaked and scratched
but luckily held; the drivers, by turns, coaxed and
threatened, prayed and swore, until at last the vehicle
was gotten under way. Papiu walked at the head of
the horses, Donald handled the reins while the younger
of the brothers, astride the leader, encouraged the
animals in the subtle, mysterious ways which only the
experienced teamster knows. As they emerged from
the protection of the firs and the thick undergrowth
the road became brighter and sloped perceptibly towards
the narrow valley which marked the location of
the mountain road leading to the West.</p>

<p>John, who was following on behind the vehicle
which had now become in reality a sled on wheels,
aided the runners, with the help of a stout stick. There
was no opportunity for conversation.</p>

<p>The girls, snugly wrapped in furs, sat in silence observing
the mighty efforts of the men and after a
while picked up sufficient courage to inquire if they
could not aid the poor animals by walking. Morton
shook his head and begged them to remain where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
were, for the present. Later on, when the climb would
begin, he might ask them to do what they had suggested.</p>

<p>With many oaths and imprecations on the part of
the men and with not a few misgivings on the part of
the girls, the valley was finally reached. They then removed
the appended runners and hid their tracks as
best they could. They followed the fairly firm road-bed
winding along the banks of a noisy mountain
stream, and struck off to the North.</p>

<p>The stars were shining brightly, the narrow crescent
of the pale moon had risen high and clear above the
mountain slopes and timber, the rattle and clatter of
the wagon had ceased and instead was heard the
crunching of crisp snow on frozen ground.</p>

<p>The road wound through densely wooded inclines,
over rocky bare stretches without a semblance of cultivation
or a sign of human dwelling. From time
to time an owl would flit across their path. Their
progress was accompanied by the sound of rushing
waters, the heavy breathing of the laboring horses and
the occasional creak of a breaking twig.</p>

<p>Helène had noticed that John&#8217;s rifle was lying across
the opening at the rear of the wagon and saw that he
himself had fastened his cartridge belt over his fur
coat. The other men also had their rifles ready and
their pistols in their belts. Papiu, she saw, had been
sent forward, as a scout. With trepidation she asked
Morton if he expected an attack.</p>

<p>John smiled and reassured her. At the same time,
he told her, it was best to be prepared for any emergency.
The wires had all been cut from Padina and
the South, and as they were traveling on the only road
leading to the Aluta Valley, they must be on the alert.</p>

<p>At that moment, a short sharp call rang out in
the distance and the horses were halted. John rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
hurriedly away. Helène was left in anxious expectation,
but he returned after a few minutes&#8217; absence and
explained that the delay was due to a tree which had
fallen across the road, and which had now been removed.
If she wished, she and the Princess could
now leave the wagon and walk.</p>

<p>The Princess was too tired, but Helène was delighted
at the suggestion. She clambered out of the
vehicle and joined Morton.</p>

<p>The moon had now reached the high heavens and
spread its gentle light silvering the entire snow-covered
landscape. Looking back on the road they
were traveling she saw the deep furrows made by the
wheels of the wagon edged with glinting crystals.
The rare mountain air sent the blood tingling through
her veins. She experienced a sense of renewed
strength and her supple and strong limbs marched to
the musical rhythm of her thoughts. A delightful
feeling of comradeship with this man by whose side she
was walking pervaded her. She felt content, quite
happily content that it should be so. How strange it
was that she should be so perfectly at ease with one
whom she had known but three days!</p>

<p>As for John his heart beat time to her steps. He
was ever ready to help her over a tree-stump or a
stone. He chatted ceaselessly of his hunting expeditions
in America, of his enjoyment of the present adventure,
of the beauty of the Carpathian landscape.
And all the time Helène noted his eyes were everywhere,
taking in everything, noting the least untoward
sound. A capital companion and a chivalrous protector,
surely, was this stranger from America! Unconsciously,
his bearing transmitted its spirit to her.
The noble blood in her asserted itself and she walked
more erectly and felt a new desire steal into her heart,
to help and be of service to others. Thus did they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
climb together the rocky ascent, each thinking of the
other and both happy in their thoughts.</p>

<p>The moonlight which had grown paler and more
mysterious now gradually gave way to the first hazy
drab of the dawn. They had reached the more rugged
parts of the mountains where the ribbed cliffs lay exposed,
uncovered by snow. Sparse brown patches of
grass and withered ferns showed on the small open
spaces. A bleak wind which had risen and was sweeping
over the unfriendly landscape made the air bitingly
cold. John threw occasional glances at the girl
by his side and noted with pain her pale, haggard face,
the eyes bright from the exercise, the parted lips
almost blue with the cold. But he also saw that she
was happy. What a splendid, noble-hearted creature,
he thought, was this! And then the longing arose in
him again to tell her of what he felt&mdash;to speak to her
of his heart&#8217;s desires; but he restrained himself,
although it cost him a great effort to do so. Helène,
all unconscious of the emotions she had excited in
Morton, would look at him, from time to time, silently
thank him with a smile and a grateful glance, gladly
accepting the helping arm he proffered. Her little
hand rested there with easy confidence, the while her
silvery laughter rang out in the clear air when the
obstacle had been overcome or avoided. And all the
way John kept thinking: &#8220;I have found the pearl of
the land&mdash;I have found her and am taking her home&mdash;home
to comfort and love. Do you love me, my
queen? Shall I win you in the end?&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, a low exclamation of warning
came from Mihai who was leading the tired horses.
John and Helène looked anxiously before them and
saw the advance guard holding up his rifle and waving
his hand. Donald also was motioning to Morton
to come forward. Urging Helène gently into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
wagon, John seized his rifle and bounded forward.
He found the men crouching behind a rock and
learned that Papiu had gone on to investigate.</p>

<p>The girls, in the meantime, sat huddled close together
in the wagon, wondering what had happened.
They listened intently, but could hear nothing but a
sound like the loud cracking as of a whip, which was
repeated several times and then ceased altogether. The
Princess was trembling from fear. She begged her
companion to let her go out, but Helène kept her back.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Morton appeared at the opening
of the wagon and nodded to them smilingly. He was
holding a compass and a map in his hands. He informed
them that they were about to take a branch
road and that there was nothing to fear.</p>

<p>Morton seized the leader of the horses by the hand
while the men pulled at the wheels. In a short pace
of time the wagon was turned round and the party
retraced the road they had traversed.</p>

<p>Soon they entered the branch road and found it to
be but a woodsman&#8217;s run. It was thickly carpeted
with pine needles and wound its narrow way through
a dense growth of hemlock, as far as the eye could see.
They drove for some time in silence, crossing a few
shallow streams and arrived at last at the foot of a
rocky height which rose sheer. Here they came to a
halt, and Morton informed Helène and the Princess
that they were to stop here for rest and refreshment.</p>

<p>Baskets were quickly unpacked and a substantial
repast was spread out before the weary travelers. The
girls ate in anxious silence while Morton explained
to them that the men had gone merely to clear the
road. They could hear, from where they were sitting,
the sound of wood being sawn and the occasional
breaking of branches. After what seemed to the girls
an endless time, the men returned and Morton announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
that they would shortly continue their journey&mdash;but
this time on foot. The men knew of a foot-path
over the mountains along which it would be more
prudent to travel than on the highway, and a tramp
of nine or ten kilometers would bring them to the
main road along the Aluta and across the divide into
Transylvania. Morton explained all this cheerfully
and said they must travel with light baggage&mdash;the
most necessary things only.</p>

<p>The girls gladly assented and in a short time they
had made their preparations for the journey. Mihai,
who had left a short time before, now returned and
mounting the wagon, drove off following the woodsmen&#8217;s
road. As soon as he was out of hearing Papiu
rose and in response to a nod from Morton, struck
out to the right, carefully skirting the ledge. Donald
followed with the girls behind him and John brought
up the rear. In this Indian-file fashion they advanced
through the timber, slipping occasionally over the
thick carpet of pine needles, but making good progress
and always mounting higher and higher.</p>

<p>Helène, whom the events of the morning had filled
with vague doubts and to whom the climb thus far
had been quite easy, waited impatiently for a favorable
opportunity to question Morton. The halt and
the return as well as the men&#8217;s disappearance had
puzzled her.</p>

<p>The opportunity came when they arrived at a relatively
level stretch, a small plateau bordered on their
left by the dense timber and gradually losing itself in
the opposite direction into the forbidding rocky expanse
of the mountain. She waited for Morton to get
up to her and then asked him what the sudden change
in their route betokened. Had he suspected any
danger?</p>

<p>Morton met her honest eyes with a perfectly assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
innocence of gaze in his own and explained
quietly that they had encountered a small patrol of a
few men on foot, who had ordered them to halt. To
avoid being questioned too closely they had started to
withdraw when one of the gendarmes had fired.
This fire they had returned and had put the patrol
to flight. One of the soldiers, unfortunately, had
been hit and left behind. Mihai, pretending to be a
peasant casually passing by, had gone forward and
had bandaged the man&#8217;s slight wound. He had left
him in a protected spot, with food and water, where
he would be easily found by his returning comrades.
It was from this soldier that Mihai had received the
information which prompted them to turn back and
take this new path. Very few people knew of a passage
or road crossing the slopes of the dreaded
&#8220;Caineni&#8221;&mdash;his own military map did not show it&mdash;Papiu
and Mihai were well acquainted with the path,
and....</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t killed one of those poor soldiers, have
you, Mr. Morton?&#8221; exclaimed Helène in awestruck
tones.</p>

<p>Morton smiled and assured her that no one had
been killed. The shots were intended to frighten them
only. Mihai had reported that the soldier who had
been wounded would be all right&mdash;his mates would be
certain to find him. Miss Helène need have no
anxiety. All her strength was now needed for the
climb that was before them. He begged her to keep
up heart and cheer the Princess.</p>

<p>They had now reached the narrow gully from
which the spring descended. Helène could not repress
a slight shudder as she saw the native guide
turn and pointing upward begin the precipitous
ascent.</p>

<p>It needed all the strength the girls possessed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
follow. Don gave a helping hand to the Princess and
John supported Helène&#8217;s faltering steps. It was a
long, tedious and heart-breaking climb. The Princess,
again and again, begged to be allowed to rest,
saying that it was impossible for her to continue much
longer. But Donald would put his arm around her
and almost carry her up bodily. Helène, pale and
staggering, found Morton&#8217;s ever ready arm to aid her
and his quiet cheerful smile to encourage her.</p>

<p>The climb once begun they dared not stop. So
up, up they went and after an hour or two the sun
became visible through the light haze which an icy
wind was dissipating. Before them appeared a horizontal
ledge and on this the exhausted girls lay down,
panting for breath. Morton decided to remain here
for a space so as to allow them to recover themselves.
He was deeply distressed to witness their prostrated
condition. He ordered the men to unroll and spread
the rugs on the ground for the better comfort of the
Princess and Helène.</p>

<p>From his blouse he drew the soft, fur-lined boots
the girls had worn in the cabin, and displaying them,
said with as much cheer as he could muster: &#8220;Here,
brave ladies&mdash;here is comfort for your feet!&#8221; With
faint glad cries they seized them and managed with a
little difficulty to exchange them for the hard leather
boots which had sorely rubbed their delicate feet.
Soon the color had returned to their pale faces and
Morton was rewarded by seeing them embrace each
other with tearful smiles. He seized the opportunity
to further encourage them by telling them that the
worst of the journey was over. &#8220;Another ascent of
160 meters,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and then the easy descent to
the smiling plains below. Let me know when you are
sufficiently rested and we will start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Princess Marie tried to smile through tears which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
were now freely coursing down her pale cheeks. &#8220;You
ought not to be burdened by me, sir. I feel I shall be
the cause of your being overtaken&mdash;I am putting
all of you into jeopardy!&#8221; Crying, Helène put her
arms about the Princess and begged her to be of good
courage. All would be well, soon.</p>

<p>Morton waited in silence, knowing that Helène
would succeed where he must fail. When he saw that
the Princess had somewhat recovered, he said: &#8220;Dear
lady, I assure you the worst is over. It is my duty
and my honor to protect you and lead you both to
safety. As soon as Mihai rejoins us we shall make
better progress. There, upon that little ridge,&#8221; pointing
ahead, &#8220;we shall rest once more and before long
we shall be at the divide. You have done nobly, Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helped by Helène, Marie rose, smiling through
tears, and finding her limbs would support her, said
bravely: &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Morton, I shall manage
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men rolled up the rugs, and the party, taking the
same order of march as before, resumed the climb.</p>

<p>Patiently and silently the girls trudged along; the
path had become almost undistinguishable, but the
footing was much firmer and easier. The ascent, however,
was steeper.</p>

<p>After great difficulty, Donald and Mihai, half carrying
the Princess between them, the party at last succeeded
in reaching the ridge Morton had indicated.
By this time the Princess could scarcely stand on her
legs. She collapsed on the rug spread on the rock.
Although suffering acutely, she begged Morton, in a
whisper, to forgive her for her weakness. Her
strength seemed to have gone from her.</p>

<p>Morton remained cool, though somewhat alarmed.
He forced some brandy from his flask between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
girl&#8217;s lips and wrapped her carefully in his robe.
Helène, tired and worn out as she also was, assisted
him in his ministrations. He could not help admiring
the splendid courage of this girl&mdash;the brave daughter
of a brave man. When he had satisfied himself that
both were resting he stood up and with a light laugh,
remarked: &#8220;There is not the slightest need for worry
now! We have any amount of time&mdash;we can wait
here for hours, if necessary. Not a soul will dispute
our path any more; and Papiu will have no difficulty in
guiding us down even after dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and paced the ledge with short steps. The
men sat removed, rifles in hand, eagerly scanning the
downward slope and the distant valley all about them;
utter quiet reigned.</p>

<p>A scarce half hour had thus passed when Helène,
looking up, saw that Morton&#8217;s face wore an anxious
expression. She noted that he was consulting his
watch and glancing frequently and impatiently about
him with an evidently carefully suppressed concern.
She dared not ask any questions, and besides, she was
too tired and worn out to summon the necessary
energy.</p>

<p>Just then the thrice-repeated call of a partridge followed
by a peculiar, long-drawn whistle, broke into
the dead silence of the desolate fastness, and from the
left, behind some gigantic boulders, Mihai was seen
approaching with long swinging stride, bearing on his
back two stout poles and what looked like a tent-cover.
The brothers exchanged a few whispered words, and
Papiu hastened back to Mr. Morton and reported that
his orders had been executed. Mihai had not encountered
any guards or militia, and he was now awaiting
further instructions. They were on the right path and
there was no snow to speak of on the divide.</p>

<p>John went forward with Papiu, and receiving from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Mihai confirmation of Papiu&#8217;s statement, he hurried
back to the resting girls, and in a voice of renewed
cheer, said: &#8220;Mihai&#8217;s report is most satisfactory.
About a thousand feet from here our path crosses a
road, which leads from the state-chaussé toward the
western country. He had been over it and found
neither patrols nor any signs of the enemy. And here
is a conveyance which will mean relief to you, Your
Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls turned their eyes to where Morton had
pointed and saw to their astonishment that what they
had thought were tent and poles had been unfolded and
converted into a strongly constructed stretcher&mdash;a
heavy canvas sheet suspended between two stout bars.</p>

<p>John spread a rug over it, and, folding another for a
cushion at the head, led the Princess to it. In this wise
they began the last stage of their ascent.</p>

<p>Mihai took the lead, rifle in the crook of an arm,
his older brother and Donald bore the crude palankin;
and, as before, Helène and Morton brought up the
rear.</p>

<p>The sun was now nearing the western slope, the
wind had died down, the air had grown colder, but
was bracing and refreshing. They reached the crossroad
so dreaded by Morton, advanced over it for some
hundreds of paces, and then once more Mihai struck
off due north&mdash;the continuation of the indistinctly
marked path that was to lead them to safety.</p>

<p>They followed this difficult road for a considerable
distance silently, every man observing carefully the
place in which his predecessor had put his foot. In
this manner they at last reached a rounded plateau
beyond which the eye saw but the unobstructed sky,
clear and cloudless, stretching its blue vault as if with
a benign promise of freedom.</p>

<p>From time to time Helène had stolen a glance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Morton, who untiring and ever present guided her
steps and aided her progress by silent encouragement.
She noticed that his face had gradually cleared, the
eyes had lost their grim expression, the deep furrow
between the brows had vanished, and his step seemed
more elastic and confident. Catching one of her looks
he smiled and pointing ahead of them, said, &#8220;There
is the divide&mdash;the boundary line!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène&#8217;s head swam and her limbs shook. John
sprung to her support. Timidly glancing up at him
she whispered, &#8220;Are you sure? You are not saying
that just to cheer me, Mr. Morton, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Comtesse, I am not. Look at our guide!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mihai had stopped upon the crest of the saddlelike
bare expanse of smooth rock they had now attained.
He had lifted his cap and was standing grinning. He
was pointing straight ahead&mdash;toward the hazy deep
green valley that had unfolded itself to their view.</p>

<p>Morton reluctantly released the girl&#8217;s arm and hurried
forward. In a voice in which he could not hide
his deep emotion he announced to Princess Marie that
they were on Transylvanian soil. A quick, happy flush
came to the haggard cheeks and glad tears filled the
soft eyes. Helène stood nearby, her bosom heaving
in happy sympathy and her eyes shining brightly.
Reverently she bent and kissed her companion&#8217;s cold
wrist. To Morton she raised a look of mingled gratitude
and admiration, the tribute of a thankful heart
that gladly acknowledged noble merit.</p>

<p>The red ball of the sinking sun threw their elongated
shadows grotesquely on the rocks gleaming in rosy
reflection. The steep parapet of the deep gorge to
their left was lit up, showing the fiery glinting narrow
ribbon of the river Aluta, winding in a wide sweeping
curve beneath them. To their right stretched forth
and loomed overpoweringly the commanding peak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
snow-capped Negoi against the delicate gloam of the
east. And straight before them unrolled hill after hill&mdash;slope
after slope&mdash;the welcome sight of deep evergreen,
of rustic brown and sere yellow, the purplish
plowed fields and darkening meadows spread out like a
checker-board. A needlelike white spire and little
bright red-capped dots of houses in the midst told of
human life, of comfort and safety.</p>

<p>Mihai had stepped aside from the path so as to
allow Papiu and Donald to put down the stretcher and
permit the Princess to alight. He was all smiles and
bubbling over with happiness.</p>

<p>The girls stood together in close embrace and followed
with eager looks the arm of their guide, who
was pointing back and downward.</p>

<p>&#8220;El Tornu Ros!&#8221;&mdash;and they beheld the deeply cut
&#8220;Red Tower Pass,&#8221; the connecting link between the
turbulent Balkans and the well-ordered country into
which at last they had entered, opening before them
like a wondrous gate. It seemed to them that they had
conquered fate.</p>

<p>Morton, quietly exultant, approached Papiu and
shook the man&#8217;s rough and soiled hand. &#8220;You have
made good, and you are all true and brave men. I
freely acknowledge your fine devotion, your quick wit
and splendid performance. In addition to the agreed
amount each of you will receive two thousand florins.
I shall never forget your services. Tell your brother
what I have said, and I shall write to Father Moskar
at the earliest opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brothers looked proud and glad, and beamed
sheepishly at each other. The words of the &#8220;gospodar&#8221;
had made them happy&mdash;the sum they had gained
meant independence to them.</p>

<p>John left the men to talk the good news over among
themselves, and approached the two girls, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
now resting against a boulder. Cap in hand, his damp
hair straggling over his forehead, he looked down and
suddenly found himself shy and awkward. The journey
over he was no longer their guide. These ladies
were noble women&mdash;and one a Princess. His words
came stammeringly: &#8220;Your Highness&mdash;Comtesse Rondell&mdash;all
danger is past&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène was the first to speak: &#8220;Mr. Morton, we
cannot tell you how much we feel ourselves beholden
to you. I hope that a more fitting occasion will offer
itself to express our deep appreciation and gratitude
for the service you have rendered us.&#8221; Her words
sounded strained to his ears; but he smiled and bowed.
&#8220;The Princess feels herself strong enough to walk,&#8221;
continued the Comtesse, &#8220;we are ready when you are.&#8221;
Morton bowed without a word and turned to the
guides with orders.</p>

<p>They resumed their downward march, and entered
the protecting woods of pink-tipped trees. At dusk
they reached the highway, broad and smooth in gleaming
gray, silently following the guides, who were
laughing and chatting with careless ease, as they
munched their bread and cheese.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a neatly gravelled path which led
to a low, rambling cottage some hundred feet back
from the highway. Here they stopped and Papiu announced
that their journey&#8217;s end had been reached.</p>

<p>It was the house of Toni Brasic, a God-fearing man
and the husband of their good sister Amuska. The
gracious Gospodinas and Gospodar Morton would be
in good hands here and very welcome.</p>

<p>A loud call accompanied by the growling of a sheep
dog brought to the door a strapping young woman,
whom the brothers greeted with sounding smacks as
their beloved niece Rossika, and who was told to hurry
and call her mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>In the cheerfully lighted and warm room the girls
sank gratefully into stiff tulip-painted chairs and greedily
drank the clear cool water offered them. A roaring
fire through the open door of an ovenlike brick stove
lit up the place and spread comfort all around. In its
warmth the girls brightened and their faces shone with
happiness. The comely stout hostess with the leathery
weather-beaten face stood looking at them with open
mouth and adoration in her eyes. In the next room
could be heard Rossika busy with her preparations for
the supper, and in a few minutes she rushed in with
a shy, smiling mien to inform the &#8220;Gospodinas&#8221; that
their rooms were ready for them. Here they found
warm water, clean linen and garments, and soft red
&#8220;saffian&#8221; boots for their tired feet. The girl helped
them, blushing and shy at the honor of serving the
noble ladies.</p>

<p>Dressed at last in their hostess&#8217;s best gowns, which
were so ample as to envelop them, they reappeared in
the living room, where they were immediately joined
by the men, and where a plentiful repast had been
spread. The natives sat at one end of the long table,
close together, whispering to each other of their adventures
and glorifying their deeds.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the table sat the two girls, their
faces flushed, their tired, deep-sunken eyes sparkling
in wondering happiness. Morton sat opposite them
in deep thought.</p>

<p>The Junolike Rossika flitted from chair to chair
piling goodies upon their plates, filling their glasses and
constantly throwing glances of intense admiration at
the girls. How different they were from the girls she
knew. They were Princesses or perhaps Queens&mdash;beautiful
as the pictures of the angels in lace-paper borders
in her prayer book.</p>

<p>Supper over, everybody expressed themselves as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
being too tired to sit up. The girls withdrew to their
rooms, and the men retired to the kitchen for a smoke
and a talk with their relatives. Morton, however, remained
to consult with Don about the program for
the next day. Soon, even these were too wearied to
stay awake, and retired to their beds.</p>

<p>The low-burning night-lamp was placed in the
chimney corner, and the house locked up for the night.
Peace and quiet soon reigned in the house where our
worn-out travelers had found their well-earned rest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MORTON&#8217;S sleep was heavy but restless. He
had thrown himself down, glad of the chance
to rest, with his mind still busied over the
day&#8217;s happenings, and doubting if he had done right
in relying on his host, Toni, to keep a careful watch
during the night. He had not &#8220;sworn&#8221; the man, so
that he was uncertain if the fellow would keep his
word. He fell asleep with the question and he awoke
with it. It had kept his mind working even in his
slumbers. He sat up quite wide awake with all his
faculties keenly alert. The sonorous breathing of Donald
jarred on his ears. In the distance he heard the
baying of a hound. Had they been followed? They
were but a little way from the border, and a quick
raid could undo all that had been done. He determined
to satisfy himself that all was right.</p>

<p>Dressing hurriedly he seized his rifle and throwing
a rug over his shoulders slipped out of the room
quietly, withdrew the heavy bolts of the entrance door
and locked it after him. It was a beautiful moonlight
night. As he stepped into the open, the faithful house
dog came bounding towards him and licked his hand.
Morton stroked the animal&#8217;s head affectionately as it
followed him in the tour he made round the house.
As he had suspected, he found no one on the lookout.
Toni had, evidently, preferred the comforts of a warm
bed to breathing the cold night air.</p>

<p>Well, there was nothing for it but to keep watch
himself. He found a wooden bench opposite the garden,
and wrapping the rug about him, sat down with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
his rifle across his knees. The stillness and the glory
of the night soothed his tired mind. Now and again
he would doze off, but he quickly roused himself.
Once again he thought of the strange adventure of the
past days. If anyone had told him a month ago
that he would be acting the part of a knight-errant
he would have laughed in scorn. That he of all men
should have done this thing!</p>

<p>He could not help smiling at the situation in which
he now found himself. And yet&mdash;why not? Would
he be deserving the name of a man if he had left these
two helpless creatures to their fate? Two&mdash;nay, one!
And his heart filled with tenderness as he thought of
Helène&mdash;the beautiful child-woman; so lovely a being,
so lovable a girl, so noble a woman. How brave she
had been; how splendid in her self-sacrificing devotion
to her friend, the Princess! Surely, there was no other
like her in this wide world!</p>

<p>What did it mean? Was this love? If it was, then,
certainly it had been love at first sight. Strange that
he, the practical man of the world, should have so easily
succumbed to this mysterious power! What would
his father have said to him?</p>

<p>The question was but a natural one, but he did not
know that however experienced and worldly-wise a
man may be, the heart of him ages less than does the
mind. And he had kept his heart pure in spite of the
world of business in which his father lived. To the
young and pure in heart Love is the one power which
must be obeyed; for that is nature&#8217;s wonderful way
of preserving her own. That is the meaning of
woman. Strive as we will in our efforts to escape, unless
some ignoble passion such as the craving for gold
or power deadens the soul within us, we must serve
God; and we can only serve him through Love.</p>

<p>Morton had taken Helène&#8217;s photograph out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
pocket and was gazing raptly at the face in the moonlight
that shone fully where he was sitting. Should he
speak to her in the morning&mdash;the last day before they
parted? No&mdash;he could not take the advantage her
helplessness gave him. He must wait until she was
free to think and decide&mdash;free of the sense of obligation
which she might now feel.</p>

<p>Replacing the photograph he rose from the bench,
and looking at his watch found that it was still three
hours before the dawn. He let himself in the house
and tried the chimney seat. But he was restless&mdash;he
was too far from where the girls were sleeping. It
would be better if he lay down in the room adjoining
theirs. He found the place empty of any couch or
bed, but spreading his rug on the floor he used his coat
as a pillow and was soon at peace in what the Easterns
call &#8220;the outer court of the Seven Heavens&#8221;&mdash;the deep
sleep of tired limbs and a clear conscience.</p>

<p>Helène and the Princess had enjoyed the evening
fully. Before retiring to bed they had exchanged
glad expressions at this happy issue out of their afflictions.
Their hearts were full to overflowing with
gratitude towards their deliverer. They realized now
fully what Mr. Morton had done for them, and could
find no words in which sufficiently to express their
feelings. The Princess began to quiz Helène about
him, but by that time the two were in bed and the light
lowered, and Helène was glad of the darkness. She
managed, however, to reply to her friend&#8217;s remarks
in a voice of cold indifference. She thought him rather
curt and domineering she said. The Princess laughed
quietly and told Helène to go to sleep and dream of
knights of old.</p>

<p>Helène said nothing and pretended to go to sleep.
It was long, however, before she did sleep. When she
awoke, after what seemed to her but a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
later, she heard a cock crowing lustily outside. In the
low light of the lamp her watch told her that it would
soon be daybreak and time to begin making preparations
for continuing their journey. Mr. Morton would
be punctual, she was sure. She would get up and dress
now.</p>

<p>Throwing aside the voluminous quilts she stepped
out of bed, though not without some pain, for her
limbs were still sore and aching from the previous
day&#8217;s exertions, and in a few minutes had clothed herself
in the garments of the stout Rossika.</p>

<p>Stepping softly so as not awaken her companion, she
left the room, walked into the outer room in which
Morton lay, and stood looking through the window.
In the darkness behind her Morton, who slept lightly,
had heard her soft footsteps. He looked up from
where he lay and saw her head and slender neck silhouetted
against the lattice-work of the window. He
could but faintly distinguish her outline, but, faint
as it was, it was enough to cause his heart to leap to
his throat and a wave of exquisite emotion to surge
over him.</p>

<p>Quickly rising he put on his coat and, before Helène
had become aware of his presence, he was by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Comtesse?&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Morton, I&mdash;I hope I didn&#8217;t disturb you.
I am so sorry. I was not aware that anyone was up
yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I frightened you, Comtesse. I have
been around the house and found that our host has been
remiss in his duty. Instead of watching he is sound
asleep in his bed. Have you had a good rest? I see
you are all prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I feel splendidly and I&mdash;I am so happy.
But, please, Mr. Morton, go back to your sleep. You
must be very tired. I&#8217;ll go to my room.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go, Comtesse. The day will be breaking soon
and we shall have to make ready for our next stage.
Besides&mdash;I&mdash;am glad of this opportunity to be alone
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mist was clearing and above the dark timber a
golden expanse was heralding the coming of the life-giving
sun. Small, fleecy clouds of amethystine hues
floated above the snow-clad tops of the Divide, now
flushing rose. They seemed like flower petals that had
been blown across the sky. In the bare autumnal
garden the last flowers, slender feathery stalks of
cosmos, stood greeting the dawn in colors matching the
coming glory and tiny dew-drops reflected the golden
sheen as they glinted on leaves and petals trembling in
the morning&#8217;s breeze.</p>

<p>Helène&#8217;s eyes sought the distant enchantment, not
daring to look at the man who had now approached
her so closely that he almost touched her. She felt
her hand being taken in a gentle grasp. Her heart beat
fast; she could feel the pulse beat in her throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse,&#8221; and Morton&#8217;s voice was very tender,
&#8220;the few days of our common purpose, the hardships
that brought us together, are now ended. To-morrow
you will be in Vienna and with your friends. You will,
I hope, soon forget the trials you have endured, the
days of anxiety in which I have come to know you.
To me they will remain ever unforgettable. You have
your way to go and I mine&mdash;duties await you as they
do me. May I hope that we shall meet again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène knew not what to say. Her hand trembled
in his and her head was bent away from his ardent
gaze. She felt his eyes though she could not see them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse, may I ask you to think of me as your
friend? I shall come back in this part of the world
soon, and if I knew the door of your friendship would
still be open for me it would make me very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Helène had raised her head and was now gazing at
the ever brightening horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton&mdash;the Princess and I owe you our
freedom, our honor and, perhaps, our lives. Not only
my friendship but my eternal gratitude is yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>She found courage to turn and look at him, but
quickly looked away again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse, it is not gratitude I care for. Will you
do me a favor&mdash;will you make me a promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène looked at him with wide, questioning eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me&mdash;that you will take no important
step in the near future until I see you again.
Promise me that you will call on me if you need help?
Will you do this, for me, Comtesse?&#8221;</p>

<p>The deep, resonant tones in which he uttered these
words swept over her like the music from a fine-stringed
instrument. It brought from her responsive
chords which found expression in involuntary sighs.
She felt a curious pride and realized that she was happy
and inexplicably glad to obey when that voice commanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; she whispered. Then her voice gathering
strength she went on: &#8220;I do not know why you
should value the friendship of an inexperienced girl,
but I am proud that you ask for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reverently Morton bowed over the little hand he
had been holding, afraid to trust his eyes to look at
her face, and kissing it softly, released it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you&mdash;and God bless you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gathering up his rug and rifle he hurriedly left the
room. Helène remained motionless for a time, then
she slowly turned to the window, on her lips a happy
smile and in her eyes a new lustre. The first rays of
the now risen sun shot through the serrated tops of
the forest and found their straight paths into the embrasure
of the window, casting a wondrous light on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
her dreamy face. Her heart felt light as thistledown.
She saw the flowers opening&mdash;how beautiful they
were! Unconsciously her eyes fell upon the hand he
had held&mdash;she still felt the lingering imprint of his
lips on it, and her face took on a color that rivalled
the rosy tints of the dawn. The great secret of nature
had been imparted to her. She could not speak of it in
words, even to herself, for the power of it had overcome
her. Instead, her hands mutely unfolded like a
flower opening under the morning&#8217;s sunlight, and her
face shone as if transfigured.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BREAKFAST that morning was, indeed, a serious
business. Everybody was ravenously
hungry. They knew that it would be some
hours before they could partake of the next meal.
Even the Princess and Helène did justice to the food
which their host had provided with true rustic generosity.
Papiu and Mihai, whom Morton had paid according
to his promise, were talking over their riches
with their relatives. They had also been presented
with the rifles and equipment used on the journey.
They were discussing Morton in awed tones, as if he
were some being of a superior world. And Toni, himself,
had occasion to agree with them, for both he and
his family had likewise been very liberally dealt with.</p>

<p>The party that gathered around the carriage in which
the two gently-bred ladies were seated, waiting for the
signal to start was, therefore, a happy if a noisily hilarious
one. Chatterings as of magpies and greetings
in Roumelian and German came from all sides. Rossika
especially was everywhere in evidence; for had not
the Gospodinas worn her clothes? She ran about
smiling and nodding and advising with heightened
color and heavy tread, as if the very lives of the ladies
depended on her final ministrations. At last Papiu,
his face all wreathed in smiles, ascended the driver&#8217;s
seat, and amid loud exclamations of thanks and adieus
he cracked his whip and the carriage rolled away, followed
by Morton and Donald in a low dray.</p>

<p>The drive to the railway station was a pleasant one,
though a longer route was taken at Morton&#8217;s orders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to avoid a possible meeting with soldiers from the
border. During the slow drive, it occurred to both
the Princess and Helène that their old friend the canvas-covered
wagon had disappeared. They wondered
what had become of it. Helène questioned Papiu.</p>

<p>The wagon? Oh, yes&mdash;the wagon had been destroyed.
Gospodar Morton&mdash;what a leader of great
wisdom he was!&mdash;Gospodar Morton had sent Mihai
away in it to deceive the soldiers who had been following
them. He was to send the wagon over a ravine
after he had set the horses free to roam in the woods.</p>

<p>Had they really been followed by soldiers? Oh, yes!
Papiu, by this time, had quite forgotten that he had
been ordered to say nothing to the ladies about the
matter. Yes, Mihai had seen them&mdash;&#8220;duke drag&#8221;
(devil take them). One of the six fellows had escaped
their rifles, for he had evidently brought assistance,
and the whole crew had been after them. But
the wagon&#8217;s tracks to the ravine had done the trick.
Ha! ha! ha! That Gospodar Morton was some leader!</p>

<p>Helène and the Princess said not a word. This then
was the explanation for Morton&#8217;s strange behavior at
the time. Then there had been fighting and killing!
What an escape!</p>

<p>When they alighted at the railway station both the
girls were very quiet; but Morton was too busily occupied
to notice the change. He monopolized the little
telegraph office for so long a time that the operator
in charge of the place thought the foreigner must be
some government official or one of those newspaper
correspondents who were everywhere. By the time the
train for Hermanstadt drew in Morton had sent off
all his messages. Within the hour they were in Hermanstadt,
the first real town they had seen since leaving
Padina, a city of early Saxon character and enterprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>As the train for Vienna was not due for two hours,
Morton drove the girls in a droshky and left them in
the rehabilitating hands of the head of the best outfitting
establishment the town possessed. He then took
the occasion to see to his own person, and make some
purchases which he knew would be welcomed by the
ladies on the long journey before them. When he met
them again at the station they hardly knew each other.
What a difference clothes make!</p>

<p>Morton had been careful to secure a private compartment
for the ladies so that they might obtain the
rest of which they were in real need; and when he had
seen them comfortably placed in their seats, he joined
Donald in an adjoining compartment of the same car.</p>

<p>The long ride was uneventful, except for the usual
bustle at the stopping places and the interest which
this aroused. It was at one of these that the Princess
procured a newspaper. She was eager to learn of what
had happened since she had left Padina, and anxiously
scanned the columns for news of her country. Suddenly,
she uttered a loud exclamation of distress, and
Helène, startled, saw her lean back and point to the
sheet lying spread in her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read this, Helène,&#8221; she cried, pointing to the headline:
&#8220;News from Roumelia.&#8221; Helène took the paper
and read:</p>

<p>&#8220;From Sophia, under date October &mdash;, we received
the following communication, which evidently escaped
the strict censorship. The <i>Divane</i> met on Saturday,
October &mdash;, and was attended by a majority of the
members. The meeting, presided over by Demeter
Sturdza, was one of intense excitement throughout.
M. Flava, after making an impassioned address, moved
a resolution demanding the expulsion of all the remaining
officials of the old régime, unless they took the
oath of the new constitution. It asked that the members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of the royal family be placed under arrest and
tried under the laws as administered by the Triumvirate.
The resolution also called for plenary authority
for himself and his two colleagues, MM. Balescu and
Calorasi. It was carried by virtually the unanimous
vote of the assembly, and President Sturdza was compelled
to sign the warrants presented. Great excitement
still prevails in the capital.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reports from Padina, so far unconfirmed, state
that the Princess Marie-Louise has disappeared with
the Comtesse Rondell, her lady-in-waiting. It is said
that the disappearance of the two ladies was connected
with the arrival of a party of some forty foreigners,
who came to Padina ostensibly on a prospecting visit
to oil-lands and for the purchase of horses. These
people bought a number of blood animals and disbursed
fabulous sums of money in other directions.
The strangers had left Padina on the very Sunday on
which the absence of the Princess was discovered. The
borders are being closely guarded, and no one is permitted
to leave the country without a passport from
the Committee of Safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;A reward has been offered for the capture of the
Princess, dead or alive. Colonel A&mdash;&mdash;, commanding
at Padina, has been arrested, and the Mayor and Chief
of Police of the town have been suspended. They are
suspected of being implicated in the plot for the abduction
of the ladies.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bulgarian government has ordered the mobilization
of the Third and Fifth Divisions of the army.
The Roumelian garrison along all the borders has been
strengthened. All officers suspected of royalist tendencies
have been imprisoned. The country is again
under martial law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène turned deathly pale as she came to the last
words. She looked at the Princess and found her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
leaning against the window her head bowed on her
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my darling,&#8221; she cried sobbingly, embracing
her friend, &#8220;what would have become of you had you
remained in Padina? What has become of all our
friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God alone knows,&#8221; murmured the Princess. &#8220;We
should have shared their fates if Mr. Morton had not
come to us when he did. I cannot forgive myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>They comforted each other and found relief in tears.
But they were free&mdash;free&mdash;free&mdash;and their hearts
filled with gratitude for the kind fate that had sent
Morton to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We owe that to your father, the Count,&#8221; said the
Princess; &#8220;he had the foresight to know and the courage
to act. Without him and Mr. Morton we should
certainly have perished.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were glad they were alone, and when the attendant
came to tell them that their sleeping berths
were ready, they lay down with thankful prayers in
their hearts and on their lips. God had been good to
them&mdash;the poor, helpless, defenseless girls!</p>

<p>The early forenoon of the succeeding day saw the
train glide slowly into the brightly lit and imposing
terminal at Vienna. It had scarcely come to a stop
when Morton appeared at the door of the compartment
with a tall and distinguished gentleman, who was introduced
as Mr. Tyler, the American Minister to Germany.
He told the ladies that Mr. Tyler would see
them to their hotel and look after them. He himself
had much to do and with very little time in which to
do it. He was leaving for England that very afternoon.
He promised to call on them later at the hotel.</p>

<p>With a courtesy that is now, alas, rarer than it once
was, Mr. Tyler placed himself at the entire disposal
of the Princess and Helène. They soon realized that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
there were gentlemen in America as well as in Europe.
He drove with them to the &#8220;Bristol,&#8221; where they were
already expected. Morton had telegraphed for rooms
from Hermanstadt. Here maids were assigned to
them, and their every requirement attended to, while
Mr. Tyler waited for them in the foyer. He had been
requested by Morton to take them around the shops
and see that they were amply supplied with everything
they might need, so that when they came down to him
he was ready for them. He acquitted himself admirably,
and the girls enjoyed their shopping to the full,
as only girls can. On their return to the hotel, they
found a telegram from Brindisi, which had been
opened and sent on by Morton, instructing them to
carry out the original program laid out for them, and
to travel by quickest route to Weimar, where they were
expected, and where they would be well taken care of.
Helène breathed a sigh of great relief. The telegram
must be from her father. Then he was alive, and,
therefore, well. God be thanked!</p>

<p>When Morton called to make his adieux, he was an
altogether changed man. The Princess, who saw him
first, scarcely recognized in the elegantly dressed and
formally polite gentleman before her, the rough leader
of the men of Padina. Her first impulse was to return
his formality with a like show of dignity; but her
heart was too full. Approaching him with outstretched
hand, she said in a voice drowned with emotion:</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot thank you, Mr. Morton, for all that you
have done. I may never forget it. But you will, I
know, understand my feelings. I am deeply, heartfully
grateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton smiled and bowed: &#8220;Your Highness, you
over-estimate my poor services. I have been honored
in your trust. I shall carry with me to my own country
the beautiful memory of a noble lady.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>She extended her hand to him, and as he bowed over
it and kissed it softly, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I may have the pleasure of seeing you at
Weimar, Mr. Morton. I shall be proud to make you
known to my people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton thanked her and bowed himself out. He
was glad that parting was over when he was again in
the little salon. It was the other parting which he now
awaited that filled him with emotion and fear. He
walked to and fro with quick, nervous steps, thinking
of what he should say when he saw her. He wished
it were over so that he might get away&mdash;the sooner
he went the sooner he could come back. As he had
begun, so he would finish. He had engaged himself in
a dangerous enterprise for Helène&#8217;s sake, moved to it
by a mere face in a picture; but now that he had seen
and come to know her very self, his whole being clamored
for her love. Nothing should come between her
and him, once he was assured of his father&#8217;s health.
If only he could wait until he had fulfilled his duties
to his dear ones at home! Ah, then, he would come
back on wings and claim her, if&mdash;if&mdash;she would have
it so. God grant that he had found favor in her eyes!</p>

<p>He was interrupted in his impassioned thinking by
the opening of the door. It was the maid who had
come to tell him that the Comtesse Rondell would be
pleased to see him. With considerable trepidation
and many misgivings he entered the apartment. The
scent of flowers were wafted sweetly to his nostrils&mdash;he
recognized it as the scent of the flowers he had sent
her a little while ago, and his heart beat again. He
saw them in a tall vase on a table near the window,
and the sight of them deepened the turmoil within him.
It was as if he had met his self-confessed self.</p>

<p>The soft frou-frou of silken skirts on carpet rustled
and Helène stood before him in all the glory of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
heightened beauty. She was dressed very simply in
silver gray, but the rose color in her cheeks gave the
contrast and drew his charmed gaze to the shining eyes
that looked at him as if they were the windows of her
noble spirit.</p>

<p>Morton stood gazing at the vision, spellbound. He
drank in the sweetness and the light of it as if these
were the one food he craved. With a bewitching smile
she moved towards him conveying a pretty greeting
with the gesture of her outstretched hand. &#8220;Thank
you, Mr. Morton, for the lovely flowers. You are
too kind. But how changed you are! Yesterday, you
were the knight of old in armor, now you look like a
gallant of the Ringstrasse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was excited and felt an unaccountable shyness
before him. She was trying to hide her embarrassment
with an attempt at badinage. Morton
sensed her feelings and tried to help her by smiling,
but he could find no words. Instinctively she saw what
was the matter with him, and with womanly quickness
she changed the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard from papa?&#8221;</p>

<p>The important question brought Morton to himself
again. He seized it gratefully. &#8220;Only the message I
transmitted to you advising your early departure for
Weimar&mdash;nothing more. I have arranged that Mr.
Tyler accompany you to Weimar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&mdash;I forgot; you are leaving us.&#8221; The rose
in her cheeks had faded slowly and left the color of
the lily behind, imparting a new beauty to the sweetness
of the childlike face. Her long dark lashes had
drooped and were quivering on the satin of her skin.
He dared not look longer or he would forget himself.
And time was pressing. He must be gone; but he
must say just one word more before he left her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse, I am come to remind you of your promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
given me at our last conversation together. You will
not forget, will you, to call on me if you need help?
I want to remain your friend, if you will permit me.
This is my card; it will tell you where you can reach
me at any time. Send me word and I will come. And
here also is a package from your father. It contains
such funds as you will need until Count Rondell joins
you at Weimar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène took the card and package and laid them listlessly
on the table on which stood the vase of flowers.
An unknown fear had suddenly taken possession of
her; she experienced a dread of dangers yet to come,
and knew not how to account for it. Her father&mdash;what
of him? Would she ever see him again? And
this gentleman&mdash;would she ever meet him again?
Morton&#8217;s voice came to her as if from a long way off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear lady, I have nothing more to say, except that
I must tell you that my meeting you has been a great
pleasure to me. I am leaving to return to my own
people whom I have not seen in two years, and who
are anxiously waiting for me. But I leave with the
determination fixed to come back. May I hope&mdash;that
you will be glad to see me when&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated, not daring to say more. Helène had
kept her eyes lowered, and at the pause she raised
them to his face. What she saw there caused her to
step back involuntarily and to speak quickly in low
but impressive tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton, I shall pray that you find your dear
ones at home all well. When next you come to Europe
you will find no heartier welcome than we shall extend
to you at Weimar&mdash;papa, the Princess and myself.&#8221;
Then looking him bravely full in the face, she added:
&#8220;And I promise you that if ever I am in need of a
friend, I shall turn to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton drew nearer to her, breathing in the faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
odor of roses which exhaled from her. He took the
hand she had unconsciously stretched towards him, and
bending over it touched it softly with his cold lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. Good-bye, dear lady, till we meet
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Au revoir, Mr. Morton.&#8221;</p>

<p>She allowed her hand to remain in his, and with the
other drew a little rosebud from among its sisters on
her breast and offered it to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; she said, smiling saucily, &#8220;is for our Bayard&mdash;<i>le
preux chevalier sans peur et sans reproche</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton took the flower reverently&mdash;&#8220;I shall keep it
in memory of the honor you have conferred on me,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Au revoir, Comtesse&mdash;May God bless you
and guard you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed once more and kissed her hand again.
Then letting it gently slip from his hold he turned to
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Auf wiedersehen</i>, Mr. Morton&mdash;and my deepest
gratitude goes with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment, and then quickly walked
out of the room.</p>

<p>As he descended the stairs sweet strains of music
reached him from the band playing in the dining-room.
They came to him as a fitting accompaniment to her
parting words, lingering in his memory. When Mr.
Tyler met his friend in the foyer he saw a face transfigured
in a new light and wearing a smile of ineffable
happiness.</p>

<p>Tyler was a man of the world and drew his own
conclusions. Ah&mdash;the old, old story! Well, he
thought, good luck to you, my boy; but aloud he remarked
to Morton that they had but very little time in
which to catch the Ostend Express.</p>

<p class="ph2">BOOK II</p>




<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE express for Ostend was punctual to the
minute, and John ensconced himself in the
luxurious seat of his compartment, glad to
be alone with his thoughts, alone for the first time
in many weeks. As he took a mental survey of what
had happened in the past three weeks, it seemed to
him as if he had lately lost his identity. Instead of
John Randolph Morton, he had been some soldier of
fortune. It was indeed time he came back to himself,
for the latest advice from home had been very disquieting.
His father had been badly shaken in an elevator
accident and, although no bones were broken, yet
coming on a previous illness, his condition might, any
day, be serious.</p>

<p>He blamed himself for his absence, thinking that
the accident, perhaps, might not have occurred had
he gone with his father on that trip to the western
mines. Then he remembered that it would have been
impossible for him to get to New York from Brindisi
until three days after the accident, and felt relieved.</p>

<p>Brindisi? Ah, yes&mdash; Where was the Count? He
was afraid the old man was no better or he would
have sent word. &#8220;I shall not see you again, my
son,&#8221; he had said on parting. Were the words to be
prophetic? If he should die, what would become of
Helène? Who would take care of her? Who will
take care of her? He repeated the question so often
that he suddenly found the clicking of the train&#8217;s
wheels over the rail-joints keeping time to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Who will take care of her? Who will take care of
her? It was as if they were reminding him of the
greater duty he had left unfulfilled&mdash;the duty he owed
to his own heart&#8217;s promptings.</p>

<p>Why had he not taken her with him? She would
have been so tenderly cared for by his mother and
by sister Ruth. And he had left her&mdash;with no friends
to protect her, with no one near to whom she could
turn in her loneliness or distress!</p>

<p>And what if her father died? Who would tell her
the sad news? How would she be able to bear up
should she hear of it in the cold words of a telegram?
Thank heaven, he had Tyler to help him. He would
provide for that, at any rate.</p>

<p>Should he write to her from London and offer her
his heart and hand? He began thinking of the possible
outcome of such an action on his part. If he
did write, was there not the danger that she might
refuse him without her father&#8217;s consent? And suppose
he heard in the meantime that Count Rondell
was dead, how could he dare to plead his own cause
at a time of such distress? Surely her heart and
mind would be closed to him, then! What a quandary
he was in!</p>

<p>Thinking thus, he lost himself in a tangle of his
own weaving. It seemed as if he were beset by
worry and anxiety from all sides. Look which way
he would, he found illness, trouble and portending
disaster there. Of what value to him his wealth and
education in this present predicament? He was up
against it, as he put it to himself.</p>

<p>What had Tyler, his father&#8217;s old friend and experienced
man of the world, what had he said to him?
&#8220;Never forget, my boy, that not one of us can escape
the rules of life as the world lays them down. The
very restraint of the conditions is salutary, aye, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
for the freedom of choice we occasionally must exercise.
Our rights would cease to be rights were it not
at the price of the corresponding duties. If a man
thinks he can cheat life&mdash;evade the rules&mdash;he&#8217;ll find he
is only cheating himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Duties? Ah, yes, Tyler was right. His duty must
come first&mdash;and he owed that to his father and to his
anxious mother. If the Comtesse Helène could not
bear up before that test&mdash;why&mdash;he must lose her. He
rose excitedly and raised the window. The night air
rushing in cooled his hot head. He stood for some
moments breathing in deep gulps of it as if it were
allaying a great thirst, staring stonily into the darkness.</p>

<p>By God, no! He would never lose her. The window
closed with a crash and he threw himself once
more on the cushions. Never, for an instant, would
he doubt her. It was up to him&mdash;everything was up
to him. He must be a man&mdash;or he was not deserving
of her. And she, oh, she was worth the winning!
Thus determined, he slept heavily and awoke the next
morning to the refreshing sounds of the Bavarian
country life.</p>

<p>All journeys have an end and in time Morton arrived
at the Hotel Cecil in London. Here he found
his mail awaiting him. A cable from home confirmed
the one he had received in Vienna. They
were glad he was soon to sail. His father&#8217;s condition
remained unchanged. The telegram from Brindisi
from the doctor was a shock. It read: &#8220;Our friend
died on November twelfth, conscious to the last, of
acute uremia and heart failure. Body in vault.
Property all sealed, your agent in possession. Wire
or write further instructions. Detailed letter mailed
you Mont Cenis mail, reach you seventeenth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton held the flimsy paper in his hand scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
believing what he had read. It had come at last. He
expected it and yet it shocked him deeply. Well, he
must be up and doing quickly.</p>

<p>The wire from Donald told him that the ladies
were leaving for Weimar that day. Mr. Tyler was
with them and everything had been satisfactorily arranged;
he had received no news from Brindisi.</p>

<p>He also opened a note from his friend Stillman
which said that he would call on him at nine that evening.</p>

<p>Morton looked at the clock; he had just forty minutes
before Stillman was due.</p>

<p>It was absolutely necessary that some person should
convey the sad tidings to the poor girl. Tyler was the
man, of course; there was time to wire him asking
him to wait for a letter. He rang for a messenger
and sent off the following telegram: &#8220;Please wait at
Weimar for my letter mailed you via Oriental Express.
What we anticipated has happened. Rondell
is dead. Say nothing to the Comtesse Helène until
you receive my letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton was putting the finishing touches to a hasty
toilet when his friend Stillman was announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Jack!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do, Harry!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two exchanged cordial and prolonged handshakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, upon my soul, Jack, old man, you&#8217;ve not
changed nearly as much as I expected. You look
perfectly civilized. Where have you been and why
are you leaving us so quickly? We surely will have
a couple of days together, eh? How&#8217;s the governor
and Mrs. Morton? What do you hear from Ruth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Harry, you are asking for my biography.
I came here from Egypt and I must leave to-morrow
for home because father has had a serious accident in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a mine elevator. Mother and Ruth report being well.
Are you satisfied, now? I suppose you are still on
deck at the Embassy? But you look fine&mdash;quite
like a Britisher. Still the same old Harry, though,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same, I guess. Same job, too,&mdash;a bit closer to
the chief, perhaps, and a bit of raise in the salary.
But, say, I&#8217;m awful glad to see you. Have you
dined?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I was hoping you would be free so that we
could go out together. I wanted to see you about
presenting some reports I have made to the British
Colonial Office. I haven&#8217;t much time, as I tell you,
and, perhaps, I may not be able to manage it this
time. But you&#8217;ll come and eat with me first. How
will the Red Room below suit you? You see, I&#8217;m
not in evening clothes and I know you fellows of the
Diplomatic Corps are sticklers on that score. Will
you take a chance with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who wouldn&#8217;t with John R. Morton, my dear
boy. You&#8217;re above clothes. The &#8216;Red Room&#8217; is all
right; but why not come up to my club, the Hoarders?
They serve a bully good dinner there and you
may meet some of our fellows. I expect the Chief
may drop in after ten and, I am sure, he wouldn&#8217;t
want to miss you while you&#8217;re in town. How does
that strike you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It suits me down to the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come right along, old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they were passing the clerk&#8217;s desk, Morton
turned to his friend and excusing himself for a
moment, left with the clerk the address of the club
where he could be found in case a message came for
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady, eh, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No such luck. Speaking of ladies, Harry, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
do you manage to escape all the beautiful English
girls&mdash;not to mention the beauties from our own
land? I should think they&#8217;d be glad to bag a Secretary
of the American Legation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A prophet, my boy, is not without honor save in
his own country. Our girls take no stock in Secretaries
of the Legation; and as for the English girls
they&#8217;ve enough Secretaries to choose from of their
own. We&#8217;re all of us only cogs in a big wheel.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stepped out of the hansom and entered the
splendid home of the Hoarders. John enjoyed the
novelty of the place&mdash;its refined atmosphere appealed
to him. The dinner was excellent and excellently
served. It was his first real taste of civilization
in two years. The two friends chatted and gossiped
over old times and new. John was treated to a good
deal of politics and not a few instances of the Chief&#8217;s
peculiarities. Evidently, it was not all beer and skittles
at the Legation. He was not much interested
really, though he gave Stillman the politest attention
and sympathy. But he could not put out of his mind
the many matters which just then were weighing
heavily on him. The very brilliancy of the room
with its coruscating crystals and heavy crimson and
gold draperies served but to accentuate the difference
between his own present situation and that
of the dear girl he had left alone and friendless. He
would write that letter to Tyler immediately he got
back to the hotel.</p>

<p>They were about to retire to the lounging room
when a servant came up to Stillman and handed him
a note on a salver. Stillman read it with a puzzled
expression on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Jack, what does this mean? There are several
newspaper fellows in the hall who want to interview
you. They learned at the hotel that you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
here and have come in a body? I didn&#8217;t know you
were a celebrity of that kind. What&#8217;s the game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea. I suppose I&#8217;d better
see them and find out. Can they come up to the reading-room?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stillman turned to the waiting servant and told him
to bring the gentlemen into the reading-room&mdash;the
small one, he added.</p>

<p>When they entered the room they found awaiting
them four gentlemen of various ages who introduced
themselves as representatives of the <i>Associated Press</i>,
the <i>Times</i>, the <i>New York Herald</i> and the <i>Sphere</i>,
respectively. Their spokesman, a Mr. Worcester,
begged permission to explain their seeming intrusion.
Morton nodded his willingness to listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton,&#8221; he began briskly, &#8220;we have been
advised of the arrival in Vienna of Her Royal Highness
Princess Marie-Louise of Roumelia and her
Lady-in-Waiting, the Comtesse Helène Rondell. We
have been given to understand that you escorted the
ladies over the border, or, in other words, that you
rescued them from the castle in which they had been
confined. Are we correct in our information?&#8221;</p>

<p>John was both astonished and chagrined. Who on
earth had spread the news? It never occurred to him
that any publicity would follow his adventure. Confound
these newspaper fellows! However, he knew
the class well from past experience and also that it
would be better if he told them the facts himself
rather than leave them to their imaginations. Assuming
a friendly and frank manner, he smiled and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, gentlemen, I shall be very glad to tell you
all I know. Pray, be seated. Harry, will you be good
enough to order some drinks and cigars for the gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was gaining time and doing some quick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
hard thinking as well. &#8220;Now, Mr. Worcester, go
ahead with your questions so that I may know what
you want me to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it not be better, Mr. Morton, if you told
us the story in your own way?&#8221; Evidently, Mr.
Worcester was no tyro at the game. &#8220;We shall ask
questions and, perhaps, more than you care to answer,
after we have had your story?&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiter came in with the refreshments and by
the time glasses were filled and cigars lit, John was
ready for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not much to tell,&#8221; he remarked in a tone
of admirably assumed regret. &#8220;So, I think, you&#8217;d get
more out of me if you put your questions first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you wish, Mr. Morton. Reuter&#8217;s report the
arrival of the two ladies at the Bristol in Vienna.
They came to the city accompanied by you and your
man. The report says further that they were left in
charge of Mr. Gordon S. Tyler, the American Minister
to Germany. Mr. Tyler denies any knowledge as
to how the ladies got out of Roumelia, nor does he
give any other information except that he is escorting
them to their friends in Germany. He refused permission
to have the ladies interviewed. We had
heard, of course, all kinds of rumors from Sophia and
Belgrade, but nothing in which we could place any
confidence. The papers have been full of the escape
during the past few days, but gave no details. That is
what we are here for now.&#8221;</p>

<p>John had made up his mind. He would tell the
story or some simple, plausible tale that would satisfy
the papers so that they would leave the rest alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, if you will have it, here it is&mdash;all
I know. My friend, Count Rondell, shortly after
I arrived in Italy on my return from Egypt, asked me
to assist him in getting his daughter to him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
gave me full instructions, provided me with the necessary
guides and equipment and led me to a place close
to the Roumelian border where we remained in hiding.
When all was ready, one stormy night, we entered a
small town,&mdash;you will pardon me if I do not give its
name&mdash;and took the ladies away in a closed carriage.
The ladies had been prepared for our arrival, so that
there was little or no delay. We managed to elude
the officials and guards and, after crossing the border,
arrived at a railway station where we took the train
for Vienna. The rest you seem to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you acquainted with the ladies before you
undertook to assist Count Rondell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. I am sure my fame never reached the
Princess&#8217;s ears. I had neither time nor opportunity
to see much of them on the journey and I question if
they know even my name. To them I was simply the
man in charge of the expedition.&#8221;</p>

<p>John sipped his brandy and soda and puffed calmly
at his cigar as he looked his interlocutor steadily in
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he added, smiling, &#8220;I am happy and
proud to have succeeded. It was certainly exciting
driving over those hills. But Count Rondell had
seen to everything and there wasn&#8217;t a hitch. Will you
have another glass, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I inquire what you are going to do now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am sailing for home on the <i>Umbria</i> from
Liverpool on Saturday morning. I haven&#8217;t seen my
people for two years. What I shall do when I get
there is hard to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I be permitted to ask a question?&#8221; The voice
came from a young, red-haired dapper little fellow
with an upturned nose on which were placed thick eye-glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Witherspoon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>&#8220;You must have driven at a break-neck speed.
Were the ladies frightened?&#8221;</p>

<p>John smiled at the inanity of the question. &#8220;I was
hardly in a position to know. As you say, we rode
fast and I sat with the driver, so there was not much
opportunity for conversation. The only occasion for
talk was when we took the train for Vienna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did the Princess appear to you, Mr. Morton?&#8221;
Mr. Witherspoon was insistent.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess appears to be a very noble and serious-minded
young woman. Perhaps I am wrong in
using the word woman&mdash;she looked so young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Almanach de Gotha gives her age as nineteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the Almanach de Gotha ought to know&mdash;the
poor thing does not look it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were the ladies surprised to find that their rescuer
was no other than the son of the richest living American?&#8221;</p>

<p>John rose in all his dignity. The pup was getting
unbearable with his impertinent questions. But he
kept himself well in restraint.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, Mr. Witherspoon, you heard me say that
the ladies knew nothing about me. There was no
occasion when it was at all necessary for them to
know who or what I was. As I have already said,
they knew me only as Count Rondell&#8217;s deputy&mdash;they
obeyed his instructions as I did. I think, gentlemen,
that will be all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reporters rose quickly and withdrew as quickly.</p>

<p>It was late when Morton got back to his hotel and
he was very tired. He would write his letter to Tyler
to-morrow, and by that time he would most likely
hear from the Brindisi doctor, and then he would
know better what to say.</p>

<p>Early next morning he received a telegram from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Tyler, who expressed his willingness to remain over in
Weimar and act on John&#8217;s letter when it should reach
him. Somewhat later in the day the French mail
brought him the anxiously expected letter from Brindisi.
It was more of a physician&#8217;s report than a letter,
and was written in a dry, professional style. Count
Rondell had rallied a little two days after landing. He
constantly inquired for letters which he was expecting.
On the fourth day, he received a letter which
made him very happy. He was much better that day.
Then he began to fail again. His heart became so
weak that it was deemed advisable to call in a specialist
from Rome. This was done, but he proved of no
help. For two days the Count remained in a comatose
condition. On Tuesday morning, he rallied somewhat.
When the message from Hermanstadt arrived
he had it read to him. The news seemed
to make him very happy and he murmured
words of prayer. He dozed off in the afternoon,
awoke in the evening and dictated a few sentences
which the nurse wrote down. Soon after he sank
slowly and expired towards midnight. The report
went on to say that Mr. Morton&#8217;s agent was in possession
of all the papers and personal property of the
deceased gentleman as well as such letters he had
written or dictated while in Brindisi. Mr. Morton&#8217;s
agent had discharged liberally all the costs, for which
the writer begged to thank him herewith.</p>

<p>Another letter, one from Morton&#8217;s agent, confirmed
the doctor&#8217;s report. He now had all the information
for which he had been waiting. Sitting down immediately,
he wrote his letter to Tyler at Weimar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Tyler</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have your wire advising that you will await in Weimar
the arrival of this letter. Thank you for this most heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I enclose herewith letter of Dr. &mdash;&mdash; of Brindisi which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
gives the details of Count Rondell&#8217;s death. I have wired
my agents in Rome to forward promptly all letters and
papers left by Count R. to you and to hold other personal
property at the order of yourself or the Countess.</p>

<p>&#8220;As, perhaps, you are aware, my dear Mr. Tyler, my
interest in Comtesse Helène is very deep and sincere. I want
you to be the person to tell her of her sad loss. You will
know how to soften the blow. She will need all her courage
and the help of a good friend in this hour of her sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would give a great deal were it possible for me to be
there to protect and comfort her; but my duty calls me home.
I have received another cable confirming the earlier one and
I fear I must be prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please advise the Comtesse in all things; you will know
best what and how. It would be best if the money left by her
father were to be deposited in an ordinary checking account
to her order. The Comtesse is a minor and you must avoid
a guardianship. She is a foreign subject and it would lead to
complications and red tape. She will do what you suggest, I
am confident. Don&#8217;t allow her to act on her own initiative,
and urge her to keep her affairs to herself. The German
laws are tedious&mdash;but you know all about that!</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be back in Europe right after New Year, I think,
and will then take occasion to thank you in person for your
splendid friendship. Father will, I hope, perhaps be also able
to thank you for having done this for his son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once more assuring you of my deepest appreciation and
hoping to see you soon, I am,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">&#8220;Yours very sincerely,</span></p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Morton</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter written, John felt greatly relieved. But
he had other tasks before him&mdash;one, the most difficult
of all&mdash;his letter to Helène herself. She had
never, for one moment, been out of his thoughts since
he left her in Vienna. He dared not put it off any
longer, especially now when she would need the
heartfelt sympathy of a dear friend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Comtesse Rondell</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend, Mr. Tyler, whom I trust you will permit to be
your friend also, has, no doubt, told you of your loss and of
the calm and happy last hours of your beloved father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>&#8220;He will also have let you know that my dispatch telling
your father that you were well and safe in Transylvania had
reached him when perfectly conscious. His mind had been
freed from worry about your welfare. He died with a smile
upon his lips, whispering a blessing.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this sad hour of your bereavement, I, a friend of but
recent date, should perhaps not presume to dwell upon it.
But I remember that I was probably the last man to whom
your father spoke freely; and it is the honor he did me by his
confidence that moves me to write to you now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dared not tell you, but we both knew, even before our
arrival in Italy, that the days remaining to him were few,
and that he despaired of seeing you again. He made me
promise to look after you, his most beloved in this world.
He was afraid you would be left friendless. You know now,
perhaps, that I am happy and proud to have this privilege.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own dear father is in serious condition and I fear
that before long, I, too, shall lose a parent. The information
I have received in another cable makes it imperative for me
to sail to-morrow for America. But for this duty which I
owe to my mother and father&mdash;nothing would have prevented
me from returning to Weimar and telling you the sad
tidings myself. Mr. Tyler, for whom I beg your full confidence,
is a most honorable and experienced gentleman. His
official position puts him where he may well be able to lighten
the terrible burden which has now fallen upon your young
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be presumptuous on my part, but I would remind
you again of our last interview in Vienna. I beg of you not
to take any important step in your life until I can present
myself once more before you.</p>

<p>&#8220;May God bless you, and soften the heavy blow that has
come to you now. May He in His great goodness and wisdom
guide your thoughts and give you the strength you need.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rest assured, dear lady, that I shall be ever ready to
devote myself, if you and the kind fates permit, to your happiness.
With my highest regard and my most fervent hope
that you will still permit me to be your sincere friend and
servant, I am, in deepest sympathy and devotion,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">&#8220;Yours most sincerely,</span></p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">John Randolph Morton</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He enclosed this letter in one he had written to
Don, because he wished Helène to read it after Tyler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
had seen her. He then drove to the Post-office and
despatched the letters himself.</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon he spent in making
various calls on officials and agents, and by midnight
he was on the train rushing to Liverpool where early
the next morning he boarded the steamer which was
to carry him home&mdash;home at last!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE following Sunday Morton, standing on the
upper deck of the good ship <i>Umbria</i>, saw in the
distance the serrated outline of his country&#8217;s
real metropolis. Up the bay, past the gaunt and gray
structures looming above the sands of Coney Island,
through the leaden murk and mist of the late autumn
day, his eyes roved and lingered, glorying inwardly
at the pride and pomp of New York. He took in
deep draughts of the air. It was good to be back
again, and his heart lifted.</p>

<p>He was met at the pier by a representative from
the office who told him that his father&#8217;s condition
was still unchanged. He had received word to tell
Mr. Morton that he was to take the train for Cleveland
without delay.</p>

<p>At daybreak, the following morning, he was once
again in Cleveland, the city of his childhood, the
place of his home. The coachman, an ancient servitor
of the Mortons, greeted him with welcoming smiles
and glad words. Even the horses knew him and
neighed as he stroked their manes. The drive through
the deserted streets, so familiar to him, brought back
to his mind so many memories that he could scarce
see the houses for the moisture in his eyes. The
tinkling of the silver harness, the hoof-beats of the
spirited animals were music to his ears. Ah, at last,
there was the tall iron gate that led to home! With
a bound he was through it and running swiftly up the
pebbled approach he almost fell into the waiting, outstretched
arms of his mother and sister.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>&#8220;Home at last, John,&#8221; cried the mother, kissing and
hugging him while Ruth had her hands on his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear mother, home at last. But how is
father?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bravely restraining her tears she told him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Father is very weak, but cheerful. The doctors
are non-committal, but won&#8217;t you go up to him, dear?
He was sleeping at little while ago, but I think he&#8217;s
awake now. And, ah, he does so want to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then followed more embracing. The handsome
mother held her boy at arm&#8217;s length, bathing him
with the lovelight that streamed from her eyes. &#8220;Oh,
but you&#8217;re so altered&mdash;so brown and big&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;just
the same dear boy.&#8221; Her voice broke in
sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m just the same, dear mother. Would
you have me different? And here&#8217;s our little Ruthie.
Little? Why bless me, Ruthie, but you&#8217;ve grown to
be quite a lady! Yes, and a mighty good-looking one
at that! I suppose I shall have to behave myself now,
eh?&#8221; He kissed her affectionately, his arms about
her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re home again. You&#8217;ll
stay with us now, always, won&#8217;t you? We did miss
you awfully. You do look nice, John. I like your
mustache, but you&#8217;ve quite a serious look in your
eyes. He looks just like you, mamma, really he does,
although not so handsome, of course. But you&#8217;ll pass
in a crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>John laughed and gave her another hug.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, old girl, I don&#8217;t mind; so long as I
look like mother I guess I&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse preceded him up the stairs to the bedroom.
Propped up in bed lay a thin, gray-haired
man, looking pale and wan, but with eyes bright and
with a look in them anticipatory of pleasure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>&#8220;Father, dear father,&#8221; John whispered brokenly as
he bent lovingly over the smiling and happy face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, dear boy, welcome home. Stand back, John,
and let me get a good look at you. My, but you do
look fit! I am glad to see you again, my lad, though
I&#8217;m sorry you find me in this scrape.&#8221; The sick
man&#8217;s eyes twinkled and a humorous smile bent the
pale lips. &#8220;Well, well, so you are ready to settle
down with the old folks, eh? No more exploring and
adventure? By George, you&#8217;re some man, John,
some man. You make me want to ask her name.
Never mind, lad, you needn&#8217;t tell me right now. My&mdash;but
it&#8217;s good to have you home again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear dad, I am so glad to be home again. You
are looking fine and not a bit changed. Get well again,
dad, because I want you to teach me how to be of use
to you. I want you to be proud of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Proud of you, John? Why, I always have been
and still am proud of you. There isn&#8217;t a finer fellow
in Ohio. You&#8217;ll make good; I&#8217;m dead sure of
that. All right, nurse, I&#8217;ll be good. John, I&#8217;m
afraid we&#8217;ll have to obey Miss Persing. She says that
six in the morning is too early for children of my age
to be up. I&#8217;ve got to sleep for a couple of hours
longer. No, you go back to mother and Ruth. I
guess they&#8217;re dying to hear all you have to tell them.
Hello, mother; good morning, my dear.&#8221; Mrs.
Morton and Ruth had that moment appeared in the
doorway. His wife went to the bedside and
kissed her husband tenderly while Ruth stroked his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the orders, nurse?&#8221; Mr. Morton asked as
he looked at her over his wife&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would better be resting, Mr. Morton. The
doctor will be here at half past eight and he&#8217;ll scold
me if he finds you feverish.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>&#8220;All right, Miss Persing, I&#8217;ll be good.&#8221;</p>

<p>The family withdrew leaving the old man, weak
and pale but with a face wreathed in happy smiles.
His head sought the pillow gratefully and soon he
was sleeping like a child.</p>

<p>It was now that John heard the full details of the
accident to his father. He had been suffering all
summer, diabetes the doctors had said. When they
came to New York from Newport, he was much improved
and felt himself well enough to go out to Utah
to look over his pet mine, the Calumet Minnie. It was
there the accident occurred. Nobody knew just how
it happened. The elevator had been inspected only
the week before. In the cage with him were the manager,
Carson, the superintendent, two engineers and
a foreman. At the hundred and fifty foot level something
went wrong&mdash;the safety clutch didn&#8217;t work&mdash;and
the cage dropped some eighty feet. Carson was
killed, the foreman also, and the rest badly hurt. His
father&#8217;s weakened state before the accident complicated
things and the doctor considered the case serious.
Later in the seclusion of her own room, his mother
broke down utterly before him. She knew his father
would never get better, she said, and she feared the
worst. John tried all in his power to comfort her, but
he succeeded only in bringing pathetic smiles to her
face and hopeful looks in her eyes as she looked
at him. He understood what was passing in her
thoughts and swore inwardly that he would never fail
her.</p>

<p>Then came the anxious days of hope and fear, when
the elder Morton&#8217;s strength failed to respond to the
doctors&#8217; treatment. To John these days were inexpressibly
distressful. Gloom settled on the old
mansion which had seen the happiest times for both
parents and children. John did all he could to brighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the home, and spent many hours with his father in
intimate talk of his ambitions and aims in life. It
was in these confidences that he learned to know his
father and, in knowing him, to honor and admire
him.</p>

<p>Dan Morton prided himself on the great fortune he
had made, because in making it he had never wronged
another and he had brought the treasures of the earth
to enrich his fellow-men&#8217;s lives. That was the secret
spring of his success and power; and he knew how to
use that power because he was most keenly aware of
the responsibility which its use entailed.</p>

<p>The younger son of a Connecticut banker, who had
made considerable money in his native state, Dan
Morton, quite early in life, had become impatient of
the narrow New England environment. He decided
to go West. With the legacy left him by his father,
he followed the then drift towards the great undeveloped
country beyond the Mississippi. Mines, ranches
and the building of railroads claimed his enthusiastic
attention. The astonishing development of the Middle
West gave his investments a solid foundation and
furnished opportunities for realizing greatly increased
values. During the second half of the decade following
the Civil War, Dan Morton had become a
power in the financial world of America. Great sections
of the Pacific Slope and the country of the Oregon
trail were largely opened up by the aid given by
him and his associates. It was in this way that he
helped to promote the country&#8217;s wonderful growth.</p>

<p>He had married a beautiful girl, the daughter of an
old Southern family and had settled in Cleveland
where he built a fine mansion. In spite of his increasing
wealth, his tastes remained simple and his manners
unassuming. Neither he nor his wife took any
active part in what is known as &#8220;Society,&#8221; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
they maintained a beautiful country house overlooking
the Hudson.</p>

<p>When his son was born, he was called after his
grandfather, John Morton. As the boy grew up he
became his father&#8217;s pride and hope. Dan Morton
looked on him as the reincarnation of himself, the
child who would grow up to be a man to carry on
the work he had begun. When the young man was
ready to enter college, he developed a rather unexpected
taste for study and research&mdash;most un-Morton
like, as his mother would say. His father decided
not to discourage the youth, but hoped that in time
he would turn from these strange gods and worship
the gods of his fathers. Indeed, he even encouraged
him, possibly because he realized that opposition
might but confirm him in his inclinations. But so
wise a man as was Dan Morton knew also that an
earnest search for truth and a true desire for knowledge
are in themselves ennobling and must result in
useful work. That John should apparently be engaged
in profitless labor, never for a moment touched his
almost religious conviction, that his son would return
to the Morton fold and hold the belief that life
meant working for a reward and that it was the
reward that gave meaning to life.</p>

<p>During the years John spent at the various colleges,
he attended at home and abroad, acquiring
learning if not wisdom, his father kept on piling up
riches, and patiently waiting for the young man to
exhaust himself of his dreamy desires and to come
back to earth, as he put it. But he always spoke of
him with great pride, and if anyone referred to his
son&#8217;s aimlessness, he would say: &#8220;John won&#8217;t play
second fiddle to anybody&mdash;not even to me. And when
I&#8217;m ready to quit, John will take my place&mdash;a better
man than his old dad was.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>This was the man that John came to know as he
had never known him before during their quiet chats
in the sick-room. It was to this man, so practical in
his every thought that it seemed as if there could
not possibly be a chord in his being that would
vibrate to romance, it was to this man that John unbosomed
himself of his secret. He told him in detail
of all that had happened, descanted, as only a lover
can, of the beauty of the girl and wound up by saying:
&#8220;I intend, dad, to make that girl my wife&mdash;if&mdash;if
she will have me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy, I am proud of you,&#8221; said his father.
&#8220;You showed yourself a man. If she won&#8217;t have you,
she&#8217;s no judge of what a man is&mdash;and the future generations
of Mortons won&#8217;t be the losers. But if she
is all you describe her to be, she knows a hawk from
a hernshaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>John laughed at his father&#8217;s way of stating the
case; but the words made him very happy. As time
passed and but scant and unsatisfying news came
from either Tyler or Don, he became very restless.
He had received one letter from Helène which he
treasured; but it contained what he took as merely a
courteous acknowledgment of her gratitude. He took
several flying trips to New York at his father&#8217;s request,
but always returned distrait and unhappy. He
wrote several heartfelt letters to the Comtesse, but
received no replies.</p>

<p>Christmas came and with it a severe winter. It
was a quiet and subdued Yule-tide for the Mortons.
Old Dan Morton was failing fast. The shadow of
the coming tragedy had fallen on the house. Before
the New Year had arrived, the elder Morton lay dead
in the stilled solemn room. The man who had been
such a power in the world had no longer any power.
Henceforth the forces of nature which he had conquered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
would deal with him in their own silent, resistless
and inevitable fashion.</p>

<p>John took his heartbroken mother and sister South,
away from the place where they had known joy and
experienced sorrow. They recovered somewhat their
interest in life amid the richer scenes and more vivid
life of the sun-bathed lands. It was here that he
spoke, for the first time, to his mother of his feelings
for a girl he had met in Europe. She said very little,
because she knew it would be of no use; and she also
knew that she could trust his taste. She saw that it
was very near to his heart, and urged him to go back.
If, she said, he felt convinced that the girl was,
indeed, necessary to his happiness, he must lose no
time in winning her. He had not told her everything
and declined to give the girl&#8217;s name or station in life.
She was good and beautiful, he said, and he was sure
his mother would welcome her and love her. In that
case, his mother urged, his first duty was to himself.
He must go at once.</p>

<p>It was not his mother&#8217;s words, however, but a cable
from McCormick that decided him. Donald had
cabled that the Comtesse Helène had left the Ducal
Palace secretly five days ago leaving no trace behind.
She had been hunted for high and low and even
detectives had been employed. Would Mr. Morton
cable further instructions.</p>

<p>John lost no time in instructing Don to continue
the search and advised him that he was sailing for
Europe by the first boat. To his mother he gave an
envelope with Helène&#8217;s handwriting on it, at the same
time begging her, if a letter came from Europe for
him addressed in the same hand, to notify him by
cable of its receipt.</p>

<p>While New York matrons who had their daughters&#8217;
welfares to think of were busy planning a season&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
siege of the bachelor millionaire&#8217;s heart, the unconscious
object of their thoughts was sailing away from
them&mdash;back to a land he longed to see because somewhere
in it lived one for whom his whole being
yearned, and without whom life would not be worth
living for him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER her trying experiences in that drive from
Roumelia, Helène welcomed the harbor of refuge
afforded her by the castle at Weimar. A
small and pretty suite of rooms had been assigned to
her in the older east wing, where her mistress, the Princess
Marie-Louise, was also provided for. Her attendance
at the Court was to begin after she had been
presented to the Dowager Duchess Clementine. A
maid had been assigned to her, and in her new surroundings
she forgot for a while her troubles, though
she could not overcome the waves of depression which
continually assailed her when she thought of her
father.</p>

<p>The maid, Josephine, a pert, little Parisian person,
proved to be an adept at her business; which is to say,
that, in addition to a capacity for ministering to a
lady&#8217;s toilet, she was a most valuable and insistent
gossip and a consummate flatterer. During her ministrations
she told Helène that she was prettier and had
hair more beautiful than any other lady of the Court.
The hair, especially, seemed to possess most remarkable
qualities. By its quality, she judged the gracious
Comtesse to be a lady of fine mind and of a strong constitution;
by its lustre, that the lady&#8217;s heart was pure
as gold; by its tendency to waviness, that its owner
would have a long life and be wealthy and happy, and
that her future husband would be great and powerful
and love her always.</p>

<p>Helène listened patiently with a smile. She knew
the tribe and knew also that it would be her comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and peace of mind if she said nothing but appeared
interested. Besides, the girl was really shrewd and very
amusing. Without her chatter, life in the castle would
have been like that of a nunnery. For the atmosphere
of the place was heavy with ceremonies and formalities.
Helène&#8217;s free spirit soon felt the restraint
keenly. She learned that it was not proper to speak
except in subdued tones, and then only of insipid matters.
Laughter was rarely indulged in, for the Mistress
of the Ceremonies ruled with an iron hand. Her
first, brief interview with this handsome and stately
dame was an experience she had no desire to renew.
She felt that she had been in a gigantic, upholstered
refrigerator after she had been permitted to retire
from that august presence.</p>

<p>Helène sat in her pretty boudoir thinking of her
father. Mr. Tyler had called the day before to tell her
that he had received a wire from Brindisi advising
that a letter was on the way. She was expecting him.
Oh, if only her dear father were with her&mdash;how different
things would be! She pictured his meeting with
the fat Dowager and almost laughed aloud. How exquisitely
polite he would be and yet how finely independent!
She could almost see the twinkle in his eyes
at the air these princelets gave themselves. She hoped
it would not be long before he would come and take
her away from these Arctic regions to a quiet and
sunny retreat where they could be alone together in
freedom and happiness. When would he come? Her
eyes fell on a little side-table on which stood a Dresden
vase with a cluster of roses in it. Ah, and Mr.
Morton, would she ever meet him again? They were
the roses he had sent her, full-blown and withering
now, the flowers hanging on wilted stalks in spite of
the care Josephine had bestowed on them.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon and the fading light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of the short autumn day spread a gloom through the
room. She rose and switched on the electric lights of
the candelabra, and turning to put the blinds down,
she almost ran into the outstretched arms of a slender
prim woman rustling towards her in silk. Helène gave
a glad cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna! dear Anna, where do you come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach, mein Liebchen, but it is good to see you,&#8221;
and the elderly woman embraced and kissed her over
and over again, the tears running down her face.
&#8220;Forgive me, Comtesse,&#8221; she begged, releasing the
girl, &#8220;but I could not help it. I wanted to see you
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Anna, I am so glad you are here, so glad.
Now that I have my dear nurse again, all will be well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my little lamb, what is the matter? Are you
sick or lonely or unhappy? Of course, everything will
be well. I am going to stay with you, my little golden
mistress. I only just heard of the Princess&#8217;s arrival,
and did not lose a minute getting here. Certainly all
will be well now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène looked at the dear face of her second mother,
and felt so comforted that she believed a Providence
had sent the good woman to her. How good it was to
be loved and to have some one near you in whom you
could trust and to whom you could tell the doubts that
were racking your heart!</p>

<p>&#8220;But how do you happen to be in Weimar, Anna?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was sufficient to open the sluices of the
nurse&#8217;s reservoir of talk; she talked so rapidly that she
barely gave herself time to catch her breath. She was
married now&mdash;to Anton Schreiber&mdash;Anton had been
chief valet to His Highness, the old Duke. They lived
now in Altenburg, in a beautiful cottage with a lovely
garden. Oh, and they were happy and comfortably
off, what with her savings and Anton&#8217;s. She had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to Weimar to visit her niece, Josephine. Why the very
Josephine who attended on her sweet lambkin! Of
course! And, oh, how her darling had grown! How
beautiful and grand she looked! And what lovely
hair! How long was it since she had seen her? Yes&mdash;three
years. Dear, dear, how time does fly! And
what had she been doing? And what brought her to
Weimar?</p>

<p>Helène waited patiently, smiling delightedly all the
time. However, the good lady&#8217;s breath gave out, at
last, and Helène had the opportunity to open up her
heart&#8217;s woes. She was so unhappy in the castle, she
explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; replied the nurse promptly, &#8220;take no
notice of the people&mdash;they&#8217;re not worth it. And we&#8217;ll
begin at once.&#8221; She rose up quickly and ringing for
Josephine said to her, &#8220;Tell the man to serve dinner
here for two. I am dining with the Comtesse.&mdash;There,&#8221;
she turned to Helène, &#8220;we&#8217;ll make ourselves at
home, and do as we like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène was astonished to find how easily it could
be done. She spent one of the happiest evenings in
her life with this nurse, waited on and served by the
lackey who looked to her the reflection of the fearful
formality of the dining-room below. The hours passed
so pleasantly that she knew not they were passing, and
was surprised to find that it was time to retire for the
night.</p>

<p>Even then Anna would not be gainsaid; she must put
her darling to bed and see that she was snug and comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so like your sainted mother,&#8221; Anna would
say over and over again, as she helped her to undress.
And Helène would cry only to be soothed again by
gentle caresses and soft murmuring words. It was
just like the days of her childhood when Anna would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
send her to sleep with plaintive songs and tales of
&#8220;Red Riding Hood,&#8221; and &#8220;Aladdin&#8217;s Wonderful
Lamp.&#8221; And when at last she fell asleep&mdash;she slept
without a dream, the peaceful, happy sleep of a
child.</p>

<p>The next morning, early, Anna was at the bedside
to see to Helène&#8217;s wants. She insisted on dividing
Josephine&#8217;s duties and taking it upon herself to dress
her &#8220;baby,&#8221; as she called her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she the loveliest child you ever saw?&#8221; she
asked of Josephine. Josephine agreed laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there isn&#8217;t a beauty like this in any other part
of the Schloss. Won&#8217;t those dry old maids be jealous!
They&#8217;ve no chance for a husband with our little girl,
have they, Josephine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; asserted that demoiselle. &#8220;They&#8217;re
sour enough to frighten any man away&mdash;the cats!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène was overcome with her blushes at the irresponsible
twittering of the two women, and begged
them to spare her feelings. But she couldn&#8217;t close their
mouths&mdash;they had not had such an opportunity in
which to indulge themselves in many a day. Josephine
went so far even as to hint of a beau, at which Anna
bridled up. Beau, indeed! Her darling had no thought
of beaux. How could she, at her age&mdash;only nineteen&mdash;the
dear, sweet lamb!</p>

<p>Helène really was relieved when the time came for
the two to retire. She was impatient, too, for Mr.
Tyler to come. It was an anxious moment for her
when his card was brought up. He came in quietly,
a gentle, sad smile on his distinguished face. She
could not restrain herself, and made a quick movement
towards him, her eyes streaming the question
that her open lips could not utter. With grave courtesy
he took both her hands very affectionately in his
and led her to a seat. And then he told her the sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
news&mdash;told it with all the kindliness and tenderness
of his finely sympathetic heart. The truth could not
be hidden, but he softened its harshness as only a practised
diplomatist like he could do. And yet the truth
was bitter. His heart went out to the poor orphaned
girl for whom he had now come to feel a father&#8217;s affection.
It was very painful to see her suffering. At first
she could not believe what she heard, and stood gazing
with wide eyes unable to move. But under Mr. Tyler&#8217;s
gentle words, she broke down utterly and sobbed as
if her heart had burst. Fortunately, Anna came in,
and carried her darling to her bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. Tyler told Anna to tell the Comtesse that he
would look after everything, and would call later in
the day, when he expected to bring with him Count
Rondell&#8217;s papers and last letters. He would remain
in Weimar a few days longer, and would hold himself
at the Comtesse&#8217;s orders. &#8220;And give this letter,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;to the Comtesse. It is from a friend. She
will be glad to receive it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a Providence that had sent her nurse
to her at this juncture; for Count Rondell&#8217;s death had
left Helène practically alone in the world. It is not
well to linger over such agonies as the poor girl endured.
They are the common lot of our humanity.
Happy are they whom they leave unbroken in spirit&mdash;it
is those they strike down who are to be pitied. Helène
was of the sterner stuff, and she was helped by her
nurse. Nothing softens sorrow as love does&mdash;and
of love Anna&#8217;s motherly bosom was filled abundantly.
Herself childless, she had it all to give to this child
of her adoption&mdash;and she gave it freely, with a large
measure.</p>

<p>The Princess, also, when she heard the sad tidings,
came to her full of affectionate sympathy; but, alas,
what could she do to help her friend! She was an exile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
now&mdash;a nobody. She would see that the presentation
was put off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear,&#8221; she cried, with tears in her eyes,
&#8220;If we only had some wise and powerful friend! We
are both of us dependent on the charity of strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>A friend&#8217;s troubles act as a salve to our own
troubles, as fire extinguishes fire, and in her loyalty to
the Princess, Helène realized that she was not alone in
her sorrow. The two girls thus helped each other in
their hour of need.</p>

<p>Mr. Tyler kept his word and came, courteously kind
and sympathetic as always. He had seen to everything.
He brought with him a considerable sum of money&mdash;her
father&#8217;s possession&mdash;and he proposed to deposit
that in the local bank in the Comtesse&#8217;s name. There
were a few formalities to be gone through in that matter,
and he had brought Herr Blume of the Laenderbank
to witness her signature to some documents.</p>

<p>Mr. Tyler reassured her of his devotion and begged
her to keep her courage&mdash;for her father&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>&#8220;You owe it to him, Comtesse,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as his
daughter. Here in this package you will find his letters.
They will tell you everything you ought to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the package reverently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know how to thank you, dear sir, for all
you have done. I shall never forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Tyler smiled, and with the liberty of his years,
bent over and kissed her hair. &#8220;Fear not, be of good
heart, and all will be well. Good-by, and God bless
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some minutes she sat alone, staring straight before
her with unseeing eyes, her fingers playing nervously
with the package on her knees. Then slowly she
broke the seals and listlessly removed the contents of
a small box.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>She found in it her father&#8217;s watch, some rings, a
small locket containing a miniature of her mother, a
bundle of letters tied with a faded ribbon and inscribed,
&#8220;To my daughter&mdash;to be retained, but not read,&#8221; and
three envelopes, two of which were sealed and addressed
to her.</p>

<p>The sight of the trinkets moved her deeply, especially
the wedding ring. She took them into her bedroom
and sat down near the window. Taking one of the
envelopes, dated October &mdash;, she broke the seal and
read. It seemed to her as if she were holding a communion
with the spirit of her father&mdash;as if she were
listening to a message from the grave:</p>

<p>&#8220;My most beloved child,&#8221; it began:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The mission I had undertaken has failed; my journey
ended in nothing. It has left me so enfeebled that I am
not able to move with any freedom from pain. The doctor
tells me I am very ill, and I realize that I am a doomed man.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long a time is still left me I know not; but I must
write to you while I still have the strength. If this letter
should reach you, you will know that I have not been vouchsafed
the blessing of coming to you myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;And in this there is no cause for either tears or mourning.
I ran a good race and have reached the goal. My one great
grief is born of the knowledge of the pain my going will
give you, my dearest child. You are so young to be left
friendless in this world!</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have arranged with my dear friend, Baron Robert
de Haas, to undertake your guardianship. He is in possession
of my will. You know him and like him. He is a man
of noble mind and large heart and he will take my place
worthily. I cannot leave you riches, my darling, but I comfort
myself with the thought that you will not regret that
fact. What I have is yours, and, with Baron de Haas&#8217;s help,
it will be sufficient to keep you independent and free from
want. For the rest you will, I know, bravely work out your
destiny in your own way.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, dear one of my heart, a few last words from
your father. A woman was created by God to be the mate of
a man&mdash;a good man. If, as I fervently pray, such a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
should enter your life and win your love, think of your gracious
mother to whose influence I owe so much. A man
deserving of your love should be honorable in the absolute
sense of that word&mdash;a gentleman, not in title, but in thought
and deed. He must be such that you will always be proud
of him and proud to be the mother of his children, if God so
give it. You will recognize him by these signs: that he is a
good son to his parents, loyal to his country and God and
proud of his honor. And if I have judged my child aright,
you will deserve him. In body and in mind, you are your
mother over again, and the earth knew not her like in beauty
of form and nobility of spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me for seeming to preach&mdash; Your happiness is
so close to my heart. You have been the reward of my life,
my pride and my joy. May you find peace and love all your
life. I am holding you in my arms as I write these last
words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mein Liebchen&mdash;Good-bye, until we meet again in God&#8217;s
own good time.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Your Father.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>A postscript, dated the same month and written at
Suez, followed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I have forgotten my illness in my anxiety about you.
Word has just reached me that de Haas is no more, and I
know not now to whom to turn. With this news came terrible
tidings of the happenings in our poor, stricken Roumelia.
I am so far from you and cannot help you. God alone must
help&mdash;and He will.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was God&#8217;s Providence that sent me Mr. John
Morton, a young American. He agreed, last night, to take
my place and go to Roumelia and rescue you from the
clutches of those rebels. He is to bring you and Princess
Marie-Louise to Weimar. If he succeeds, and I am confident
he will, let him guide you in your next step. He is a gentleman,
and he can help you. You may rely on his word and,
if I am a judge of human nature, he will not fail you.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless to say much&mdash;and needless to say more.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could have come myself, I would not have sent a
substitute.</p>

<p>&#8220;May God take you under His protection.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Helène&#8217;s face was bathed in tears. It was with
trembling hands that she opened the second letter. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
handwriting was feebler and the lines very uneven.
Evidently, her father had written it under great mental
stress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Brindisi</span>, November 6, 189&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Darling Child</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton left two days ago for Roumelia with my
prayers. I have heard no news of what is happening there
and I fear the worst.</p>

<p>&#8220;My strength is failing fast and the doctor sent me from
Rome by my American friend has been very frank with me.
I have but a few days more in which to live.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I am still able to think clearly and write, I must make
full use of the time left me. I omitted to tell you in my
previous letter something which I think you ought to know.
When I first spoke to Mr. Morton of going to Roumelia, I
spoke on behalf of the Princess. He refused absolutely to
undertake the journey or to mix in any way with the political
affairs of the country. Indeed, he was indignant with me
for what he considered my presumption in asking him to
engage himself in an enterprise of such danger and risk.
His first duty was to his parents and he was called to them.
I was not surprised at his attitude, but I had no alternative.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was during my pleading that I accidentally uncovered
a portrait of yourself, and, to my utter astonishment, he suddenly
changed his mind and accepted the task. I tell you this
because I think you should know it. The man is a noble
fellow. I feel that in my heart. If he should succeed in his
mission and you are once more free, do not hesitate to accept
his friendship. If I knew that you would do this I should die
the happier for knowing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can say no more, but pray and hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you and protect you, dearest.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The third unsealed envelope contained a simple note
written in a strange, feminine hand, in French.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Brindisi</span>, November 14, 189&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Paola Rimoni, nurse and attendant to his Excellency
Count Rondell-Barton who has requested me to write
down his last words, as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;A telegram from Monsieur Morton has just arrived announcing
that his party has safely crossed the border. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
man has justified my faith in him. May God reward and
bless him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I send my daughter my blessing and my dearest love. I die
happy knowing that she is safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;My gratitude to Monsieur Morton, my homage to Her
Highness, my last kiss and blessing to my beloved child.
Roumelia forever!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Below was scrawled in letters that were barely decipherable&mdash;&#8220;Rondell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène was too overcome to move from where she
sat. Through the window came the pale light of the
waning day tinged with the red of the sinking sun.
The room was filling with deep shadows. She saw
nothing. Darkness seemed to have fallen on her.
Slipping to her knees she laid her aching head upon the
seat and prayed inwardly, the while the scalding tears
fell down her cheeks. It was thus that the faithful
Anna found her an hour later.</p>

<p>The first great sorrow of youth is the inheritance of
tears that have fallen before. It is the burden of existence
for an erring humanity. It means and must
ever mean that the blood which has flowed from others&#8217;
hearts is the blood which will flow from our own. One
generation must depart to make room for a generation
to come; and the burden of sorrow we have received
from those who have gone before us we shall pass on
to those who come after us. Happy are they who can
weep in their sorrow, for tears are a blood-letting of
the spirit.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes in the morning they fell
on the Dresden vase now bereft of its flowers&mdash;the
petals lay scattered on the table and carpet, and only
dried stalks showed where a few days ago glowed the
red damask of roses. Was this to be an omen of her
own life? She shivered at the question. Rising
quickly she gathered the petals with loving care, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
taking the dried stems from the vase placed both in
a drawer of her dressing-table. She knew now that
her heart lay with the faded leaves.</p>

<p>She remembered the letter Mr. Tyler had left with
Anna. It was a message from the man whom her
father had blessed with his dying words. So he was
going&mdash;sailing over the ocean to that far country where
was his home. Would he, too, lose his father? How
cruel life was? He had signed himself, &#8220;in deepest
sympathy and devotion.&#8221; The words were like balm to
her sore heart. No&mdash;she was not alone in the gray
world! And the sunlight of the morning was repeated
in her smile.</p>

<p>In the company of her faithful nurse, Helène traveled
the short distance to Sigmaringen, the home town
of her mother&#8217;s family, to attend her father&#8217;s funeral.
Mr. and Mrs. Tyler were present, and their presence
helped her not a little to bear the trial. On her return
she found Donald waiting for her at the railway station.
Her heart gave a bound when she saw his lanky
figure and hard yet kindly face. The sight of him
comforted her greatly, and she was glad to accept his
escort to the Schloss.</p>

<p>The next day she was compelled to undergo the
trial of an interview with the Mistress of the Ceremonies,
Baroness Radau. It was necessary that she
should be coached in the duties incumbent on a lady
of the Court of Saxe-Weimar. While expressing sympathy
for her in her bereavement, the majestic dame
admonished her to repress her grief. It was not
proper to show undue emotion. She must read the
lives of the forty-nine dukes of the blessed realm and
become acquainted with the works of Goethe and
Schiller, who were the glory of Weimar. It would
also be very necessary for her to know the proper way
to bow and the precedence of rank; and, above all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
she must never forget that next to God came Duke
Ernest Victor the Seventeenth.</p>

<p>On account of her mourning, the color of her presentation
dress was to be a subdued gray, under a
special dispensation. It would be of the regulation
style. Perfumes were permitted, but only of a particular
kind. Her Highness did not favor any but that of
lilac. Her hair must be plainly arranged and drawn
tight and smooth across the brow. She might wear
pearls.</p>

<p>The day of the ordeal of the Presentation came at
last. She went to it with the greatest trepidation and
returned from it almost prostrated from the strain of
waiting her turn. She had been permitted to touch the
gloved hand of the voluminous Dowager and the hands
of the reigning Duke&#8217;s consort and her own Princess.
Poor little Marie-Louise looked like a martyr waiting
to be led to the stake as she stood on a slightly lower
dais than that on which the Dowager sat, dressed in
stiff silk weighted with gold embroidery. When Helène
approached her, she cast big sad eyes on her friend
like those of a doe flying from the hunters.</p>

<p>Having been presented, Helène was now permitted
the freedom of the Court. Her duties were simple
but weariedly monotonous. They amounted to a regulated
routine of formality and enforced idleness. She
was permitted to appear in white or gray at the gatherings,
but at the Chapel, which she attended twice a
week, she was allowed to wear black. She was deprived
of Josephine&#8217;s services and given in her stead
a soured old maid, who was far more experienced and
would be able to instruct her in the punctilios of the
Court. Anna was no longer in Weimar; she had gone
back to her little cottage and her beloved Anton.</p>

<p>But there was one pleasant interlude in the dreary
round of her week&#8217;s life, and it came to her on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
way to and from Chapel. On these occasions she
would find McCormick waiting for her at the castle
gate to learn of her health and to know if he could
be of any service to her. Sometimes, after service was
over, she would invite him to accompany her in her
promenade round the Square within sight of the
Schloss. On those occasions she would lead him to
talk of his master, a subject on which Don was ever
ready to descant. She would listen to him with downcast
eyes, but with secret delight. These talks added
fuel to the flame in her heart and warmed her lonely
spirit.</p>

<p>Winter came, and with it the snow, which buried the
little Thuringian castle in its white mantle. The monotony
of her life palled more and more on her since
she was now deprived of her walks. Occasionally a
letter from Mr. Tyler and Anna would come as a ray
of sunshine.</p>

<p>One never-to-be-forgotten day she received a box
which, when she opened it, she found filled her chamber
with the delicious scent of flowers. They were orchids
of the purest white, sent by Morton. &#8220;Heartiest good
wishes to you on your birthday. May you see many,
many more in health and happiness.&#8221; The words
were inscribed on his card. She had not realized that
this was the last day in November, and that she was
now twenty. That morning at the levée she attracted
the curious glances of the women by the lovely orchids
she wore at her breast. Not a few whispered malicious
insinuations to each other.</p>

<p>Helène had but few opportunities of meeting her
friend, the Princess. When she did she found her very
unhappy. The poor girl had been made to feel her
equivocal position at the Court, where she was treated
as though she had come there uninvited. She had no
means of her own, and this compelled her to be dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
on the good-will of people who, though royal in
blood, were very mean in spirit, especially where money
was concerned. There is no king so pompous as the
kinglet, and as a consequence he attracts to him the
effete and the provincial in mind&mdash;men who will cringe
and fawn and flatter, and women whose only enjoyment
is in gossip and slander. It was from the latter
especially that the Princess suffered&mdash;and Helène also.</p>

<p>With the coming of December came preparations
for the Christmas festivities. The Court was all agog,
Helène excited with the rest. She had a better opportunity
to know the &#8220;noble ladies&#8221; now. In mixing
with them she occasionally caught whispers about
&#8220;Americans,&#8221; and people who sacrificed their pride of
descent on the altar of money. And she would notice
that they cast side glances at her as they spoke. She
did not altogether comprehend the meaning of their
attitude, but she realized vaguely that she had become
a <i>persona non grata</i> with these high-born tatlers, and,
as a consequence, her unhappiness increased. She
thought of her bank account. Perhaps these women
had found out about it! Surely, it had been her
father&#8217;s money that Mr. Tyler had brought her! The
half question brought a doubt. Had Mr. Morton sent
it? How absurd! And yet&mdash;yet&mdash;he was so generous.
She would speak with the Princess about it.</p>

<p>The two girls talked it over and even went into
calculations, in their simple way, as to the cost of the
expedition Morton had undertaken. They were forced
to the conclusion that Morton must have borne that
himself; nay, that it was to his generosity they owed
the very clothes they wore. Now they understood the
dark references to &#8220;Americans&#8221; and money. Helène
determined to find out the truth by writing to Mr.
Tyler.</p>

<p>The reply she received did not clear the matter. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Tyler thought she was making a mountain out of a
mole-hill. She had far better leave well alone. So far
as he knew, the moneys he had brought her came from
her father. It could not be otherwise since they were
drawn out of the Banca Nationale, where they had
been deposited in Count Rondell&#8217;s name. He expected
Mr. Morton&#8217;s arrival early next month, and no doubt
he would call on her. He advised her to forget the
matter until then.</p>

<p>Helène was torn by doubt, and humiliated in her
pride. She did not know what to do nor where to turn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">CHRISTMAS morning came and with it came
another box of flowers&mdash;glorious roses, this
time, of a deep red and of a scent breathing
sympathy to the lonely girl. Enclosed was a card
bearing the one word, &#8220;Greetings.&#8221; She pressed the
lovely flowers to her face as if kissing the hand that
had sent them. The contact with the velvet petals
soothed her troubled spirits. When she met Donald
that day she asked after his master. Don shook his
head&mdash;he had nothing to tell her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you still in Weimar, McCormick?&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>McCormick grinned. &#8220;Weimar is all right, Miss,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve no home to go to. Besides, orders
are orders, Miss, and I&#8217;ve got to stay here in case you
might need me. Say the word, Miss, and I&#8217;ll be ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thanked him with a pathetic little smile. The
roses and Don&#8217;s words were enough for one day.
She re-entered the castle thinking that her Christmas
had been a very happy one.</p>

<p>The next day the Princess came into her room
looking greatly distressed and holding a periodical
in her hand, which she held out to Helène.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is the explanation of the malicious
gossip.&#8221; It was a copy of an English society
paper, three weeks old, which an English friend had
sent the Princess. It contained a scurrilous article
dealing with Morton and his adventure with the two
ladies in Roumelia. As Helène read her heart seemed
to turn to a stone&mdash;a feeling of nausea overcame her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>After stating the fact of their escape from Roumelia,
the article went on to say that Morton, the hero
of the adventure, had received but scant courtesy
from the two ladies. They treated him with cold
indifference, scarcely deigning to hold any conversation
with him. As for Count Rondell-Barton, who
was supposed to have planned and financed the expedition,
he could not have been very active in the matter,
since so far from being on the Roumelian border,
he never came closer to it than Brindisi. When,
however, the proud ladies arrived in Vienna and
learned from the American Minister to Germany who
and what their rescuer, Mr. Morton, was, their whole
bearing and attitude towards that gentleman changed
entirely. They became as friendly then as they had
been cool before. The millionaire was quite a different
person from the stranger who had risked his
life for them. What a tale Mr. Morton would have
to tell when he went back to America; and what would
he think of Europe&#8217;s nobility!</p>

<p>And now, as she had finished the vile writing, she
was filled with indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who inspired this disgraceful composition?&#8221; she
asked her friend. The Princess shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I spoke to Count Radau about it and he said
that no one would pay any attention to what this
paper printed. It had a bad reputation in England
and, no doubt, lived on purveying this kind of
stuff to readers who like it. He advised me to
forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s such a tissue of lies and misrepresentations,&#8221;
cried Helène in her anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; but that&#8217;s the way these vile creatures
live&mdash;by debasing their talents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is too terrible. I shall be ashamed to show
my face anywhere now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>&#8220;We cannot help ourselves, dear Helène; we must
bear up in the hope that the good taste of the Court
will leave us free from gossip.&#8221; The Princess spoke
lightly, but in her heart she was deeply chagrined and
distressed.</p>

<p>As for Helène, she could not put the thing out of
her mind. It was as if she had been soiled with the
mud of the streets. She never, for one moment, believed
that Mr. Morton had had anything to do with
it. Some enemy of her father&#8217;s must have inspired
it, she thought. What a cruel thing to do!
What degradation of mind to sell itself to such a
service!</p>

<p>It was with a breast filled with indignation and
pride that Helène attended the gathering in the small
reception-room, that afternoon, to take her part in
the Christmas-tree ceremony. She stood a little way
from the rest as they waited the arrival of &#8220;their
highnesses.&#8221; There was much chattering going on
and not a little simpering and giggling among the less
reserved women who had evidently come to enjoy
themselves. She could not help noticing one particular
gentleman who passed as a wit among these light-headed
ones and was the centre of a bevy of dames
all seemingly delighted at some of his witticisms.
And then she heard an ample young countess remark
that the Hebe from the Balkans was not interested in
cutting them out&mdash;she was too much taken up with
Mr. Moneybags from America.</p>

<p>Helène turned white and grasped the balustrade of
the nearby stairway. She could scarcely stand on
her legs and her bosom heaved from her labored
breathing.</p>

<p>An elderly lady, a Madame de Martis, had also
heard the words and saw the girl&#8217;s condition. Quickly
stepping up to her, she whispered: &#8220;Compose yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
my dear child, and come with me to the dining-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène clutched at the lady&#8217;s arm and gave her a
pathetic smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Madame, they have no hearts.&#8221; Then recovering
herself, she added: &#8220;But cost it what it may,
I will tell them what I feel. I have borne it so long
that I can hold out no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her recovered anger brought the color back to her
face and gave her strength. Advancing rapidly
towards the group, the members of which were gazing
at her in supercilious surprise, she stood before them
boldly erect and with her eyes shining&mdash;a thing of
ineffable beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will listen to what I have to say,&#8221; she cried
in clear, ringing tones, and the whole assembly turned
spellbound at such colossal temerity. &#8220;I know I am
transgressing all the laws of this Court, but you may
do your pleasure after I have finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several gentlemen came forward to beg her to be
composed, but she waved them away with a fine
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have my say. The Princess and I came
here to a place of refuge&mdash;we are alone in the world
with no man to help us. The common laws of hospitality
demand that we be treated, at least, with some
show of courtesy, but you have thought fit to ignore
them. You have not only made me realize my dependence,
but you have insulted my honor and questioned
my motives. And now that you have learned
from a vile paper the base insinuations of a base mind,
you have accepted them as the truth, to afford you a
little amusement in the dull circle of your lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame de Martis had taken one of the girl&#8217;s arms
and was hysterically appealing to her to leave the
room with her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>&#8220;Pardon me, Madame, it is too late now. I have
begun and I will finish what I have to say to these
distinguished members of the Court.&#8221; Her voice had
grown stronger; the expression on her face became
as if a holy light had transfigured it. The women
were terrified and the men admiringly interested; but
neither moved a foot; they stood as if under a hypnotic
influence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman to whom we owe our freedom is
not here to speak for himself. If he were, you would
not be so free with your insinuations. He did what
I doubt any man here would have had the courage to
do&mdash;he helped a dying man and two friendless girls.
Without that help we should never be alive to-day,
and I am proud to acknowledge the debt I owe him.
You, gentlemen of Thuringia will, I am sure, appreciate
my sentiments. And as for the lying gossip of
that paper which you ladies of the Court have so
eagerly accepted, you are welcome to make of it what
you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned proudly and marched majestically out
of the room. But the door once closed, she staggered
blindly up the stairs and fell fainting on her bed.</p>

<p>The spell over the assembled courtiers was broken.
There succeeded a noise of talk such as that reception
room had never heard since the castle was built. From
all sides resounded indignant protestations, disclaimers
and denials. Here and there came expressions of
commiseration and even avowed desires for apologies.
When, finally, the Baroness Radau&#8217;s voice could be
heard, they quieted down. The Baroness would
confer with the Dowager Duchess and the Comtesse
Helène&#8217;s conduct adjudged. In the meantime, the
ladies and gentlemen would do well to await Her
Highness&#8217;s arrival.</p>

<p>When Helène recovered consciousness, she lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
thinking dully of what had occurred. There was, no
doubt, in her mind about the consequence of her act.
She made up her mind not to wait for the royal verdict
and its inevitable punishment. Anywhere was
better than to be in this heartless place. She would
rather live with servants and working people than
with these so-called high-born men and women. She
had money&mdash;thank God for that! She would use it
whether it was rightly hers or no. She would go to
Anna, her nurse, who was the only one who really
loved her. Anna was good and wise. She would
help her and guide her. She would know what was
best to do.</p>

<p>Thus firmly resolved, she bathed her hot, tear-stained
face and retiring for the night, cried herself
to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning she rose, rested and greatly
refreshed. After partaking of a hearty breakfast, she
left the castle and took a &#8220;droschky&#8221; to the Laenderbank.
The ordeal she had feared proved a very
simple affair after all. Her request for money was
immediately attended to and she left with several thousand
marks snugly tucked away in her pocketbook.</p>

<p>Her absence from the castle had not been noted.
Once in her room again, she set about collecting the
articles she held as her treasures, including the faded
rose leaves and orchids, and packed them carefully in
a box. Opening the door softly, she beckoned to a
passing lackey and asked him to send Josephine to her.</p>

<p>Josephine came in haste. She had not seen her
dear Comtesse for days and wondered what she had
been called for. Helène told her she was going on a
visit to Mr. and Mrs. Tyler in Berlin, who had invited
her to spend New Year with them. At once
the maid became excited and busied herself most energetically
in packing the Comtesse&#8217;s trunk and valise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
The proceeding took but a short time&mdash;Helène&#8217;s wardrobe
was not extensive. A carriage was ordered to
be at a side door and a lackey helped to load it.
Before leaving Helène left a note for the Princess in
which she begged her friend&#8217;s forgiveness for the
step she was taking.</p>

<p>At the railway station her courage oozed out of
her. She was afraid she had been followed and terrified
at the thought of the Baroness Radau&#8217;s cold
eyes. Her eyes filled with tears as she glanced helplessly
around her. But a guardian angel in the shape
of a dignified railway official, seeing her evident distress,
approached her with a bow and begged the
&#8220;Gnädiges Fräulein&#8221; to permit him to take charge
of her baggage. She could hardly keep from hugging
him, so great was her relief. The uniformed
giant soon had her settled comfortably in a first class
compartment with her baggage safely on board the
train. &#8220;The train will leave in twenty minutes for
Altenberg, gnädiges Fräulein,&#8221; he informed her,
well pleased with the change she had left with him.
Ah, at last, the train was moving. At last, she was
safe, and laying her aching head against the upholstered
back of the compartment, she closed her eyes
and dozed happily to the rhythmic jolting of the
wheels, which were carrying her away from the gilded
prison and its cruel jailers.</p>

<p>At Altenberg the patriarchal conductor came to her
assistance. The sweet face of the girl with its plaintive
expression had touched him. He ordered a porter
to see to her baggage and procured a carriage for
her. She looked at him, for a moment, as he held
out a hand, then she nodded and smiled and left him
feeling fully recompensed, with the smile.</p>

<p>Anna lived at Garten-strasse No. 60 in this the
smallest of capitals of Duke-ridden Thuringia. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
way to it lay through the Main Street and by little
snow-covered garden plots to the still outskirts. The
neat cottage stood behind a brick wall in which was
a prettily wrought iron gate.</p>

<p>A pull at the bell-handle was succeeded by the shrill
barking of a diminutive dog between the bars of the
gate, and the appearance of Anna in a bibbed apron.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach, my baby!&#8221; she almost screamed, and gathered
the girl to her warm bosom. &#8220;So you did come,
after all. Oh, I&#8217;m so glad, so glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a lovely little home you have,&#8221; cried Helène
as she looked around the room into which Anna had
ushered her and which was so inviting in its furnishing
and reposeful effects.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is nice, is it not,&#8221; assented Anna with
pride in her face. &#8220;But, my dear, you are tired from
the journey and will enjoy a little luncheon, won&#8217;t
you? Of course. I&#8217;ll have it ready very soon; but
come to your own room first. You see I have it all
ready for you. Ach, won&#8217;t Anton feel honored when
he sees you here!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until after luncheon, when the two were
seated together in &#8220;the best room,&#8221; that Helène found
her opportunity to tell Anna of the real reason which
had brought her to Altenberg. The nurse listened
quietly at first, but towards the end of the narrative
she became so excited that she kept jumping from her
seat, pressing her hands together out of sheer indignation,
and ended by embracing and petting her
&#8220;child&#8221; with all the sympathetic words her full heart
enabled her to murmur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the mean, nasty cats,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I knew
from the first that you would never be happy in a
place like that. I told Josephine so. You did quite
right in leaving as you did. You will stop here,
which is your proper place now; and you can stay as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
long as you wish. We shall have the loveliest time,
and the house and everything is yours. The idea,
their not letting you go in mourning for your dear
papa! Why, I never heard such a thing! It&#8217;s wicked,
positively wicked. We&#8217;ll see to a proper dress for you
at once. We have a very good dressmaker here who
will fix you up elegantly. Oh, the cats, the vipers!&#8221;</p>

<p>Anna would have gone on much longer if Helène
would have listened. But she laughingly smothered
the dear lady in an embrace and begged her to forget
it now as she herself had done. She would be glad
to find her home here for the present and was grateful
to Anna for her loving kindness.</p>

<p>Thus, at last, did Helène find a resting place for
her tired head. Here she could be alone with her
thoughts, study a little and arrive at some definite
plans for the future. Perhaps, her troubles were now
over and things would take a change for the better.
For the winter, at least, she would accept Anna&#8217;s kind
hospitality.</p>

<p>Soon the spring would come&mdash;ah, the spring!
She would not plan so far ahead. She would leave
it in God&#8217;s own merciful hands. The lines from the
English poet came into her mind. She smiled happily
as she murmured the hope-giving words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">Oh, Wind,</div>
<div class="verse">If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?</div>
</div></div>

<p>Spring with its budding of trees and flowers and
growing of green grass; with the coming of the hope-giving
sun and blue skies, and all the thousand beauties
that make the heart glad, then surely would come to
her a new strength and a kinder life. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;but
she dared not think of that. If God so
willed it spring might bring him also, and then&mdash;ah,
then, let come what may. It would, indeed, be a new
life!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">HELÈNE&#8217;S life in the home of the Schreibers
begun so happily continued as happily for
many weeks. She communicated with no
one in Weimar because she wished to forget, so far as
she could, the wretched time she had passed there.
She had not told the Princess where she was going
and, in her haste, she had forgotten to inform Donald
McCormick. It was better so, she thought, at any rate
for the winter. She would be happier alone with these
humble and kind people.</p>

<p>The people of Altenberg knew her as Miss Barton.
Frau Schreiber had taken care to explain to them that
Helène was the daughter of a lady in whose service
she had been; and was staying with them for the winter,
for a rest.</p>

<p>Life, in a little place like Altenberg, especially to
one accustomed to the atmosphere of a refined home
and the association with people of culture, is at best
a more or less dull round of daily duties. One must be
born in such a place to accept contentedly its simple
offerings of friendly intercourse and common interests.
For a time, the novelty of its picturesque streets,
its quaintly pretty houses, its museum and historical
landmarks, satisfied Helène&#8217;s appetite for variety. She
enjoyed the &#8220;sights&#8221; as a tourist who might be visiting
the place. But familiarity, if it did not breed contempt,
did certainly destroy the novelty, and what once
was enjoyed as variety now palled because of the
monotony. The variety itself had become a sameness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Even the different neighbors of the Schreibers
took on a ridiculous seeming of likeness to each other;
and Anna herself, good and kind as she undoubtedly
was, became like the rest. Good people are seldom interesting,
and kindness alone does not always mean
that their thoughts are in sympathy with our own.</p>

<p>So that pretty Altenberg and its simple folk began
in time to pall on Helène. Anna noticed the change,
and put it down to the absence of congenial society.
She determined to supply the want. The well-meant
remedy but aggravated the disease. The good woman
took every opportunity to be with Helène, and it was
not long before the girl was almost afraid to see her
approaching on her kindly mission bent.</p>

<p>As often as the weather permitted, Helène would go
for long walks. She could the better &#8220;think things
over,&#8221; as Anna would say, when alone in the open air.
She realized that wise as the step had been she had
taken in coming to Altenberg, it was just as wise now
that she should leave it as soon as the winter was over.
She must not be a burden on anyone. She must go
away and find something to do&mdash;some occupation by
which she could earn, at least, a living. For she had
made up her mind that she would use no more of that
money Mr. Tyler had placed to her credit in the bank.
She was not at all satisfied that it was her father&#8217;s
money. The six thousand marks she had drawn out
on leaving Weimar she would keep. She had calculated,
at least to her own satisfaction, that this was
about the sum which her father might have possessed.
By what process of reasoning she arrived at that conclusion
only a knowledge of Helène&#8217;s honest and unworldly
nature could explain. But the conviction was
fixed and with it also the determination to provide for
her own future by the work of her own hands.</p>

<p>The days grew longer; the cool airs began to whisper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the promise of spring. With the approach of the season
Helène&#8217;s spirits returned. Her body, too, threw
off the lassitude which the winter&#8217;s confinement had
brought on. Her cheeks showed a little of their old-time
rose-color; her eyes grew bright. Youth was
reasserting itself at nature&#8217;s silent call.</p>

<p>One afternoon late in February, on her return from
a visit to an ancient church, she was surprised to see
Herr Kauffner approaching her dressed in holiday
attire. She knew him as a prosperous tanner, and a
friend of the Schreibers, and although he was a member
of the town council it was not usual for him to be
walking out on a week day dressed in his Sunday
clothes. Her surprise was not lessened when, on doffing
his hat, he stopped and begged permission to accompany
her home. There was an impressive formality
about the request which made her feel very uncomfortable,
but she could scarcely refuse.</p>

<p>Herr Kauffner was a heavily built man with a temperament
that scorned circumlocution. He wasted little
time and less words in coming to his point.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am happy, Fräulein Barton,&#8221; he began with a
self-satisfied air, &#8220;to have this opportunity of speaking
with you alone.&#8221; He cast an ardent, admiring glance
on what he could see of her face. &#8220;Indeed, Fräulein,
I have been wishing for it ever since I had the good
fortune to make your acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène quickened her step&mdash;they were nearing the
main street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am one of the richest men in the Faubourg,&#8221; he
went on, and this time with a distinct note of pride in
his tones. &#8220;I am a good-natured fellow, in the prime
of life and sound as a thaler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène turned pale and increased her pace as she
kept looking about her anxiously in the hope she
would see some person she knew.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>&#8220;But&mdash;I am a lonely man. I ask your permission
to visit Herr and Frau Schreiber more frequently as
a suitor for your heart and hand. May I so consider
myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène was utterly at her wit&#8217;s end what to answer.
Her rapid steps had brought her to the turning of
the street in which the Schreibers lived. She paused
for breath for a moment and looked at Herr Kauffner
with such surprise and frightened eyes that he
stepped back a pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for the honor you have paid me, Herr
Kauffner,&#8221; she was able to say, &#8220;but it cannot be. Permit
me to go home now alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>And without giving him time to answer, she almost
ran down the street into the house. Once in the hall
she did not pause, but walked quickly up the stairs,
clinging to the balustrade for support and threw herself
into a chair in her own room, overcome from exhaustion
and fear. She had not dared to announce
her return to Anna, as she usually did after her walks;
she was afraid Anna might question her on seeing her
distress.</p>

<p>For many minutes she sat trying to still the beating
of her heart. The rush of blood to her head had made
her dizzy. After a time she was able to get on her feet
and bathe her face in cold water.</p>

<p>Then the humor of the situation took her, and she
smiled. Poor man&mdash;he meant well. She had been
rude to leave him so abruptly. What would Anna
say? How could she tell her?</p>

<p>Just then she heard a noise of some one entering
the next room and the sound of the closing of the door.
Then came loud voices in dispute. Anna and her
husband were talking about something that had evidently
made them angry. The voices came nearer and
she heard Anna say distinctly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>&#8220;You are very unreasonable. You ought to be
proud to have her here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what you say; but I&#8217;m not. You keep on
telling me of the honor your &#8216;gracious and noble Comtesse&#8217;
is doing us by being here. But I don&#8217;t see it.
After slaving all these years to be my own master, do
you think I&#8217;m going to be a servant again? And yet
that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m being driven to. Since she came
I am compelled to eat my meals where I won&#8217;t be in
the way of your &#8216;precious lamb.&#8217; I am not allowed to
talk loudly; I can&#8217;t have my friends visit me and enjoy
a bottle of wine; I must be always dressed up and
keep on my best behavior&mdash;and in my own house, too.
I never heard of such a thing. I can&#8217;t smoke my pipe
except in a back room, and as for my wife, why I see
so little of you now that I might just as well never be
married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anton, you must not shout like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not shout! Why not? Isn&#8217;t this my house? I
don&#8217;t care who hears me. I&#8217;d just as soon tell her if
she were here. Before she came I was as happy and
proud as a duke. Here we&#8217;ve been working all these
years&mdash;for what? For our home. And now that
we&#8217;ve got it&mdash;where is it? Not in this place. When
I want my wife, you are fussing with the &#8216;gracious
Comtesse&#8217;; when I ask you to come for a walk, you
tell me &#8216;Lady Helène needs me&#8217;; when I want to talk
with her, you tell me I don&#8217;t know how to talk to a
noble lady. What do you think I am&mdash;a stone, a fool,
or a man? I&#8217;m sick of it all. I want our old life back
again&mdash;I want my wife&mdash;my home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anton, you are beside yourself. Don&#8217;t you know
the poor girl has no one except us to help her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let her do as other girls do&mdash;let her marry
a decent fellow and have her own home. I don&#8217;t mind
her visiting us&mdash;but I don&#8217;t keep a hotel!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>When Helène had realized that it was she who was
the cause of their quarrel, her weakness became such
that she lost the power of movement, and collapsed in
the chair. She tried to cry out in an effort to make
them aware of her presence in the house, but her
tongue clove to the roof of her mouth&mdash;she could but
sit helpless and listen.</p>

<p>She heard Anna weeping and saying bitter words
to her husband. How he must have resented her coming
that he, a man usually so mild and gentle, should
have been roused to such anger. She heard a violent
slamming of a door followed by the sound of quick,
heavy treads down the stairs, and then, a deadly
silence.</p>

<p>So this was to be the end! An adverse fate must be
pursuing her. Wherever she went unhappiness followed.
Even those who would befriend her suffered
because of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I was dead&mdash;dead, and with dear papa,&#8221;
she murmured brokenly, for she was too wretched to
cry.</p>

<p>She must go and go at once. Anna must not suffer
because of her. She had come between her and her
good husband who loved her. Anton Schreiber was
right. His wife and his home were his, and she had
no right here.</p>

<p>But where should she go? Ah, that was a hard
question to answer. She would not go back to
Weimar, and she knew nobody anywhere else. If
only Donald were here&mdash;he would surely help her.
She must go to some big city where no one would
know her and where she could easily hide herself. But
if she went with Anna&#8217;s knowledge, that dear woman
would suspect she had overheard the quarrel. She
must leave without her knowing it.</p>

<p>Her mind made up she stepped quietly down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
stairs and out of the house to the rear where the
Schreibers&#8217; little maid-of-all-work had her room. The
girl adored the Fräulein Barton and would do anything
she asked. Helène bound her to secrecy. She
was going to Munich on a visit, she told her, and
didn&#8217;t want Frau Schreiber to know. Could she get
anyone who would take her trunk to the station? The
girl smiled. Of course she could. The butcher&#8217;s boy
would do it for her any time. When? She&#8217;d bring
him that evening at eight o&#8217;clock. He could bring
the trunk downstairs to the laundry and in the morning
he&#8217;d come round with his cart and take it
away. Her Hermann would do it for a thaler&mdash;not
for him, but for the porter at the station. That
settled it.</p>

<p>Helène returned to the front door and entering
noisily called out for &#8220;Mamma Anna&#8221; as she usually
did to announce her arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you, &#8216;Mamma Anna,&#8217;&#8221; she called up the
stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m resting in my room,&#8221; came the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to write some letters. Call me
when supper is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, dear Comtesse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once in her room Helène commenced packing her
belonging quietly, but rapidly. It took but a little time
and the trunk locked, she carefully moved it, inch by
inch, until she had succeeded in placing it at the head
of the back staircase where the maid&#8217;s Hermann would
be sure to find it.</p>

<p>At the supper table, Helène told Anna of her encounter
with Herr Kauffner. She treated the matter
lightly and in a way that would not offend Anna. But,
to Helène&#8217;s surprise, Anna was most indignant with
the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell that gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
something that&#8217;ll keep him away. That man
marry my darling&mdash;why it&#8217;s preposterous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s forget all about it, Anna dear. Shall I play
you some of your favorite songs?&#8221;</p>

<p>And without waiting for her assent she sat down at
the piano. But Anna was not to be restrained. She
loved to have Helène play for her, but her indignation
took a long time cooling, and Helène could hear her
muttering as she busied herself clearing the table:
&#8220;Preposterous! The idea! I never heard such impudence!&#8221;</p>

<p>Anton Schreiber came in all smiles for Helène, but
she felt too ashamed to look at him. She stopped playing
and was about to rise and leave the room, when
he begged her to go on. She pleaded weariness, however,
and, excusing herself, retired to her room. The
two, she thought, would be better left alone; it would
give them an opportunity to become reconciled with
each other.</p>

<p>In her bedroom she was again a prey to anxiety.
What would she do in Munich? To whom could she
go there? She thought of Morton and wondered
where he was. He believed her to be still at Weimar,
for she had written him but once since they had parted&mdash;a
simple acknowledgment of his birthday-gift. She
had promised to let him know if ever she was in need
of a friend, and surely she was in such need now!
Should she write to him? Torn by anxiety and pride
she knew not which way to decide. After much reflection
she concluded there could be no harm in letting
him know that she had left the castle. Taking pen
and paper she began; but it was only after several attempts
and with many misgivings of heart that she
finally decided to send the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Morton</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have left the home offered me by the Duchess of Saxe-Weimar.
I was too unhappy there. I tried most earnestly
to become reconciled to my surroundings, but the dull routine
of the empty life of the Court, the heartlessness of its
people, were more than I could bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have now decided to try to find my own proper place
in the world&mdash;to get some occupation in which I can be
happy and, at least, be free to live my own life. I have not
forgotten my promise to you not to take a serious step without
consulting you, but I am sure you will agree that I have
acted for the best.</p>

<p>&#8220;The letters of my father which Mr. Tyler gave me only
deepen the feelings of gratitude your kindness aroused in me.
I know everything now and I must ever honor the man who
proved himself so noble a friend. If I do not ask your
advice now before deciding it is because I know too well
what you would do&mdash;and I cannot again burden you with my
sorrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please forgive me if I seem proud. I ask only for time,
in which to plant my feet on firm ground and, perhaps, find
some peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have taken some of the money Mr. Tyler gave me, so
that I shall not be in want. What other poorer girls can do
I can.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall write you again in the autumn when my year of
mourning for my dear father is over. Until then, think of me
as kindly as you can and believe that I am obeying an inner
voice which commands me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, Dear Mr. Morton,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">&#8220;Very gratefully yours,</span></p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Helène Rondell-Barton</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter took a long time writing and had cost
Helène many a heartache and not a few tears. She
had been filled with doubts even while writing it. It
was so easy to shift her burden, and this man would
have accepted it gladly. But how would she seem in
his eyes in that case? How could she accept such a
service from one who had already served her so abundantly?
What right had she thus to call on him?
No&mdash;the letter was best. She felt more at ease with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
herself, more determined in spirit, more resolute of
purpose, stronger in will, now that it was written.</p>

<p>Early the next morning she packed her few remaining
possessions in a small valise and, after leaving a
short note for Anna, crept out of the house and
made her way to the railway station where she mailed
the letter to Morton. She waited until the butcher&#8217;s
boy had brought her trunk and took a second-class
ticket for Hanover, where in due time she arrived.</p>

<p>An official at the railway station of whom she inquired
after a hotel recommended the &#8220;Hanover.&#8221;
Here she obtained a comfortable room and after satisfying
her hunger she sat down by its window in the
dark to think out a plan of action for the following
day.</p>

<p>She sat for a long time looking out on to the brilliantly
lit avenue with its display of the city&#8217;s night
life and wondered what place she could fill in it. It
was a new world to her&mdash;a bewildering world&mdash;even
a terrifying world. She must now mix in it&mdash;play
her part in it unprepared and unaided. Her heart
sank at the thought. And this was what was meant
by life! This was what thousands of girls had to face!
Well, she would face it, too, and do her best. If others
could succeed, why not she? And if she failed&mdash;but
she would not think of that. She would not, must not
fail. She would begin by going to an employment
agency and offer herself for a position as governess.
She knew French, German and English&mdash;these were
not common accomplishments and, surely, they were
wanted and would be paid for!</p>

<p>But what a change from her life in Roumelia! Ah,
beloved Roumelia! She pictured the Rosen&#8217;s home
in Padina&mdash;the last real home she had known. It
brought Morton back to her mind. Involuntarily, she
closed her eyes to the lights without, so that she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
be alone with her image. Had he meant all that was
implied in his last words? Or had he but used similar
words to her that he had spoken to other girls he
knew? No, no, no, she could not believe that. He
was not that kind of a man. Her father had said of
him that he was true and noble, and her father, a wise
man and of great experience, knew men well. It was
wrong in her to doubt him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must leave the rest,&#8221; she whispered softly, &#8220;in
God&#8217;s good hands. Until, then, good-bye, my knight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus, greatly encouraged and with a mind calmed
and at rest, she lay down and slept the happy sleep of
those who feel they are loved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">TRUE to her resolve, Helène called the next
morning at the &#8220;Agentur für Gouvernanten,&#8221;
the address of which she found in a directory
at the hotel. The experience was a disappointing one.
The official gave her a form to fill out for her name,
address, accomplishments and references. The registration
fee was six marks, payable in advance.</p>

<p>As she had no references to give, since she did not
wish any of her friends to know where she was, she
filled in the form without the references.</p>

<p>Helène began to realize that finding a situation
might take a much longer time than she had expected.
She, therefore, decided to leave the expensive hotel
and take a room at a modest pension. She was soon
accommodated and spent her days mainly in reading
and answering the advertisements in the daily papers
and the &#8220;Teacher&#8217;s Journal.&#8221; On two occasions she
received replies requesting her to call, but nothing
came of her visits&mdash;she could give no references. She
persevered, however, convinced that something would
turn up some day.</p>

<p>The days lengthened and the snow had disappeared
altogether from the streets. In the park, where she
loved to take her walks on sunny afternoons, the
keepers were busy cleaning up the grass plots and planting
flowers. The trees were beginning to burst into
foliage; the leaf buds of the lindens were swelling;
the birches began to show their pretty little pussy-tails
and the sparrows and starlings were twittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
their first spring songs. The faces of the people she
met took on expectant and hopeful expressions.</p>

<p>One beautiful, sunny morning she received a letter
from a Frau Professor Heimbach, asking her to call
in response to her application for a governess for her
two children. The Frau Professor lived on the second
floor in Hegel Strasse.</p>

<p>Helène had no doubt she had at last succeeded in
getting what she had been hoping for. She was so
overjoyed that, for the first time in months, she sang
while eating her breakfast. She arrayed herself in
her best clothes and set out looking the very incarnation
of the lovely spring weather.</p>

<p>Hegel Strasse looked like the very place in which
a Frau Professor might live. It was in a very respectable
neighborhood and the house itself a faded remnant
of a one-time dignified and imposing structure.</p>

<p>With a beating heart Helène ascended the unadorned,
cold stairway and pulled the bell-knob below
the brass-plate which indicated that Professor Albert
V. Heimbach, Ph.D., lived within. She could hear
in the distance the shrill tinkling sound of the bell.
After what seemed to her an eternity the door opened
and an unkempt maid with a red upturned nose appeared.
To Helène&#8217;s request to see the Frau Professor,
the servant made no reply, but looked her over
very carefully from head to feet. The inspection appeared
to be satisfactory, for the girl nodded and beckoned
to Helène to come in.</p>

<p>At the end of the narrow entresol and sharply outlined
against the bright light which came from a distant
room, Helène saw a tall, slender woman approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you wish, Madame?&#8221; she inquired of
Helène.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>Helène explained that she had come in response to
the Frau Professor&#8217;s advertisement for a governess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into the room, and be seated.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the increased light of the sitting-room Helène
faced a tired and somewhat faded woman, still young,
but of a most meagre appearance, and painfully flat-chested,
with pale bluish eyes and thin bloodless lips.
The close fitting bodice of her dress accentuated the
length of a thin neck which stuck up from her shoulders
and seemed as if it were a stalk bearing the small
head above it. She spoke in cold, knife-edgy tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you had any experience as a governess of
children, Fräulein?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;Frau Professor&mdash;but....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Fräulein&mdash;answer only my question,
if you will be good enough. Have you any references
from your pastor, or the Council of your district?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, gnädige Frau Professor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you feel yourself competent to teach my two
children the subjects of the North German School
curriculum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I am quite competent. I am fond of children
and....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, I did not ask you for that information.
Have you ever taught children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Gratz&mdash;I assisted the Sisters of the Holy
Heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your accomplishments?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I speak French very well&mdash;also English. I play
the piano, draw and paint a little and can embroider
and sew.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Frau Professor&#8217;s face seemed as if it might
have been touched by a faint interest&mdash;it almost smiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Painting and embroidering were evidently desirable
qualities. She had kept her feet crossed during the
examination but she now separated them and displayed
a pair of shabby shoes sadly down at heel. Leaning
forward she examined the very young applicant carefully
but not unkindly.</p>

<p>The door leading to an adjoining room, just at that
moment, slowly opened, and after a few moments Helène
saw a curly-headed, blue-eyed little girl stretch its
head into the room. The mother turned quickly and
called out: &#8220;Close the door, Emilie&mdash;you must not be
inquisitive.&#8221; The child disappeared instantly. Helène
felt sorry to see her go&mdash;her heart had gone out to the
dear little thing.</p>

<p>The interruption seemed to have acted on the Frau
Professor as a reminder of her position. She leaned
back and folding her arms gazed for a long time at
Helène&#8217;s face and clothes with a dreamy look in her
eyes. Finally, she seemed to make up her mind and
began to speak, at first hesitatingly and then more
firmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fräulein, will you let me tell you something&mdash;something
which I believe you will thank me for hereafter?
You are looking for a position as governess in
a family. By your own admission you have had no
experience in such work and cannot furnish testimonials.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène turned pale and then reddened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to be perfectly frank with you,&#8221; resumed
the thin lady; &#8220;I admit that your accomplishments,
your appearance and your manners are greatly in your
favor; but you are seeking for employment in the
wrong direction, Fräulein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Frau Professor,&#8221; cried Helène eagerly, &#8220;I can
learn; and I am so anxious to please. I would love
to teach your children, and I am sure they would like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
me. I shall try to make them like me. Won&#8217;t you
just give me a trial, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Frau Professor&#8217;s brow clouded and her face
turned a brick-red color. With an effort she seemed
to be suppressing her feelings. Then, laying a hand
on Helène&#8217;s gloved ones, she bent over and in a softened
voice said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My child, you cannot and should not expect that
from me. Ten years ago when I married I was a
blooming, fresh girl like you are, though, perhaps, not
quite so attractive. Look at me now. See what those
ten years have done for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood up and stretched out her arms. It was
a pathetic gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband is a kind and good man. He has his
work to do and his studies. But the romance of his
life&mdash;so far, at least as I can affect it, has gone out
of him. Look at me and you will see what the drudgery
of household duties, the care of children, the worry
of making both ends meet, have made of me. My
youth has departed from me, and with it have gone
all the joy I have known and all the beauty I ever
possessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you expect that I should bring a beautiful young
being like you into my home? Why, my dear, your
presence would be a daily reminder to me, and to my
husband, of my helplessness and futility. I could
not compete with you. And there is not a woman in
Hanover who would dare risk it. I am not doubting
you. I am sure you are good and pure. But we are
all fighting to keep the little flame of our husband&#8217;s
admiration still burning in his heart for us. It is so
small that it would die, oh, so easily if ... ah, my
dear Fräulein, it is impossible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take my advice and marry some good young man.
Or, if you must find an occupation, look for it where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
women do not rule. Forgive me for my plain speaking;
I do not mean to pain you. Were I a great lady
with a magnificent household and many servants, I
would engage you without a moment&#8217;s hesitation. As
it is, it is out of the question. I ask your pardon,
Fräulein Barton, and wish you a good morning and
good luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène knew not how she found herself in the street,
but the sunshine seemed as if it had been washed from
the sky suddenly as by a soiled rag. She walked
mechanically, her heart numb, her brain dulled, without
knowing where she was going. She had but one
conscious feeling&mdash;to hide herself, to be alone. At
the corner of the street she hailed a &#8217;bus and shrank
into its remotest corner. She allowed it to pass her
pension; she would go into the park and sit there
and think over what she should do. There at least
she would not be molested. The trees and birds and
children would not chide her.</p>

<p>In a quiet circular spot edged with boxwood she
found a seat on a bench in a sunny corner where the
tender green of the shrubbery spoke of a reawakened
life. The sparrows hopped about her for the cake
crumbs she threw them. It was too early in the season
for the nurse maids and their perambulators and only
occasionally a park gardener would pass along the walk
wheeling his barrow of turf or soil and leaving behind
him the fresh scent of earth.</p>

<p>Helène sat in a pathetic mood, too depressed to think.
Her encounter with the world had stunned her, and she
found herself utterly at a loss how to renew the attack.
Suddenly, she heard the crunching sound of quick,
firm foot-treads on gravel. Turning her head in the
direction of the sound she saw a tall, fine-looking
woman coming straight towards her. As she approached
nearer, Helène noticed that she was young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and neatly dressed in a smart tailor-made costume
which set off to advantage a splendid, though rather
stout figure. She recalled now that she had seen this
young woman in the rooms of the Arts and Crafts
Exhibition, and had admired her freedom and grace
of movement, so unlike that of the other women. Evidently
she was a foreigner.</p>

<p>In passing, the lady gave Helène a smile of recognition;
then stopping suddenly, as if on a second
thought, she turned back and went up to where Helène
was sitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind my sitting here?&#8221; she asked with a
smile.</p>

<p>Helène was so surprised at being spoken to by her
that she could only nod her assent. She passed her
gloved hand quickly over her face to wipe away the
tears that had fallen unbidden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me, Fräulein. I know how you feel.
I&#8217;ve been in trouble myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène looked up and met two kindly brown eyes
looking in sympathetic admiration into hers. The
face, with its healthy coloring and expression of good
nature, drew her in spite of herself. She could not
resist its strong appeal. Smiling bravely, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in trouble; but I feel ashamed of my weakness
in giving way. Thank you for your sympathy.&#8221; And
rising, she made as if to go.</p>

<p>But the other put a restraining hand on her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, don&#8217;t let me drive you away. I&#8217;m a
stranger here. Won&#8217;t you sit awhile for a chat. I
think I saw you at the Art Exhibit. My name is Margaret
Fisher. I am an American and am here on
business. Don&#8217;t be frightened, I can assure you I&#8217;m
a perfectly proper person. I may be able to help you,
if you will let me, Fräulein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good,&#8221; replied Helène, reseating herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
&#8220;I, too, am a stranger here. This is my first
visit to Hanover. My name is Helène&mdash;Helène
Barton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helène&mdash;what a pretty name! Then you are not
a native, though you talk like one. Well, I&#8217;m not looking
for information, thank goodness. Are you staying
long here, Miss Barton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a few weeks only. Both my parents were
German born, but I know no one in this city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are alone and an orphan, just like myself.
Well, we should be friends, then.&#8221; She drew a tiny
watch from her belt. &#8220;It&#8217;s past twelve; won&#8217;t you
come and take lunch with me? I should enjoy having
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I shall be delighted. Do you live
near?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m staying at the Metropole. I suppose you live
in a pension. Much better; but I&#8217;m only a transient&mdash;here
to-day, gone to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I live at a pension; but I often go out for my
lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, then we&#8217;ll go to the Park restaurant. It&#8217;s
nice and quiet there, and we can have a good talk.
You needn&#8217;t be afraid to come. I&#8217;m big enough to
chaperon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène laughed happily. It was so comforting to
hear her friendly, soft, confident voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly look as if you could take care of
yourself, Miss Fisher.&#8221; The two laughed as they
walked towards the restaurant.</p>

<p>The good luncheon which Miss Fisher ordered
proved an excellent solvent for Helène&#8217;s state of mind,
and Miss Fisher herself knew well how to break down
any barriers of restraint that might still remain. It
was evident that she wanted to help this young and
beautiful girl in distress, and when a woman of Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Fisher&#8217;s temperament makes up her mind, there
is nothing that will stop her.</p>

<p>It was not long, therefore, before Helène had unbosomed
herself of all her anxieties and told her
new-found friend of the difficulties which she had
encountered in her efforts to find some occupation.
Miss Fisher looked at her admiringly with tender,
motherly eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor dear!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I know all about it.
I&#8217;ve been through it myself. My father was a German&mdash;his
people lived near Hanover, which is one of the
reasons why I am here. My business brought me to
Europe and I took the opportunity to look them up. I
am the head of a high-class dressmaking and millinery
establishment in New York, Madame Lucile&#8217;s, and I
came on a buying trip. I&#8217;m going back next week&mdash;as
soon as the new models are ready for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be splendid to be so capable as you are,&#8221;
Helène remarked with a sigh of regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but you don&#8217;t get there, my dear Miss Barton,
without a great deal of heart-breaking work. It&#8217;s not
so easy as it looks.&#8221; Miss Fisher&#8217;s face clouded a little
as if recalling an unpleasant past, but her face resumed
its bright and alert expression almost before the
shadow had left it. She looked at Helène&#8217;s beautiful
countenance for a long time and then suddenly she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me help you? You are too young
and too pretty to fight this battle alone. It will make
me happy, if you will. I have lots of money&mdash;my firm
pays all the expenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are more than kind, dear Miss Fisher. Thank
you. I know you mean well; but I&#8217;ve some money of
my own. I&#8217;m not so helpless as all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène spoke with her gentle and distinguished courtesy,
smiling charmingly at the same time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>&#8220;My dear&mdash;let me call you Helène, won&#8217;t you?&mdash;thank
you. You see I&#8217;m much older than you are,
both in years and experience of life. We&#8217;ll drop
the subject for the while; but let&#8217;s stick together so
long as I&#8217;m in Hanover, shall we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be only too pleased. You are so encouraging
and so&mdash;strong. You make me feel very hopeful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;ll just go about and see the
sights. Maybe we&#8217;ll think something out before my
week is up.&#8221;</p>

<p>They spent the afternoon together, and Helène
promised her new friend to call on her that evening
at her hotel to look over the purchases she had
made.</p>

<p>The evening provided a rare experience for Helène.
Miss Fisher showed her a collection of wonderful
laces, ribbons, trimmings, jets and ornaments which
had been acquired for the New York market. What
impressed Helène more, however, was the quick decisive
manner with which Miss Fisher explained everything;
the nimble hands which displayed the articles
to their best advantage; the ready words which fell
from her lips in praise of their qualities. Helène had
never imagined a woman could be so capable, and at
the same time so jolly and witty.</p>

<p>Miss Fisher, in her turn, had not failed to observe
in her shrewd way, how quickly Helène assimilated
the information, and how alert the girl&#8217;s mind showed
itself, in spite of its natural reserve. The remarks,
too, she let fall evinced a taste and judgment quite rare.
She insisted on taking Helène to her pension in a cab,
and promising to look in on her in her exile, as she
put it, left her in a happier state of mind than she had
known in many a day.</p>

<p>Miss Fisher returned to her hotel in a very thoughtful
mood. She knew enough of life to guess that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
young acquaintance was a gently nurtured girl of a
refined family, unhappily thrown upon her own scant
resources, and in danger of being wrecked on the rocks.
Her beauty, her gentle ways and voice, the pure, simple
mind she had shown, all had made an indelible impression
on her and had won her completely. She
made up her mind to befriend her.</p>

<p>The next morning Helène was surprised to realize
how eagerly she was looking forward to Miss Fisher&#8217;s
coming. The short acquaintance, so unusually begun,
had so quickly ripened under the benign influence of
the American girl&#8217;s way of doing and saying things
that Helène was quite conquered. It was all so novel
and yet so humbly pleasant that she wished it would
go on always.</p>

<p>This was the first of a number of meetings between
the two. Miss Fisher sounded Helène, and soon became
convinced she was really in earnest. She did
not probe too deeply into the girl&#8217;s family history&mdash;only
just enough to find that her judgment had been
correct. She learned that Helène could speak English&mdash;and
what a charming English it was, too! She was
sure Madame Lucile would be delighted with her. She
would be a real acquisition to the business, she felt
convinced of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, my dear,&#8221; she said suddenly on one of
their walks, &#8220;why not come with me to New York?
You tell me you have neither friends nor relatives and
not even an admirer&mdash;so there&#8217;s nothing to keep you
here. Come with me, and I&#8217;ll see that you get a position.
New York is a beautiful city with more opportunities
for a girl than any other place in the world.
You needn&#8217;t be afraid; I&#8217;ll look after you. We can
have a little apartment together and live the jolliest
of lives. You are a born artist, as I saw from your
drawings and sketches. I am sure you&#8217;ll get a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
position with the people I&#8217;m with. Will you come?
Say the word, and we&#8217;ll fix it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène&#8217;s big blue eyes opened wide in astonishment
at her friend&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really mean it? Can I really do the things
you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you can,&#8221; and she put her arms around
Helène and kissed her. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be a couple of the happiest
girls in Manhattan. And no man shall come between
us, either, miss&mdash;do you hear? Oh, I&#8217;m so
happy.&#8221; And Miss Fisher forgot her dignity and
jumped again. &#8220;I can just see Madame Lucile&#8217;s expression
when she sees you. I&#8217;ll tell her I&#8217;ve brought
the cleverest designer of hats in Europe&mdash;the peer of
modistes! And won&#8217;t Miss Foucher, the head trimmer,
stare! Hooray.&#8221;</p>

<p>It did not take Miss Fisher long to make all the
necessary arrangements for the voyage. She had Helène&#8217;s
berth engaged, a steamer trunk at her lodgings
and a quantity of necessary purchases made in less time
than it would have taken Helène even to think about
them. The money she spent seemed enormous to
Helène.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, my dear. These things cost far more
in New York, where you&#8217;ll want them&mdash;and you&#8217;re
saving money by buying them here. It&#8217;s dollars in
New York&mdash;not marks. Just you leave it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène looked on aghast and could make no answer.
Miss Fisher had told her she was &#8220;some shopper,&#8221; and
she had certainly not exaggerated. The way she made
the clerks skip about sent the cold shivers down Helène&#8217;s
spine. By dusk every article had been arranged
for, and there was now nothing to do but wait until
the next morning&#8217;s train, which would take them to
Bremen.</p>

<p>As this was to be the last evening before sailing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Miss Fisher proposed a &#8220;blow-out.&#8221; They&#8217;d have
dinner together and go to the opera. With Miss Fisher,
to propose was to act. The dinner was most enjoyable,
and the opera, &#8220;Romeo and Julietta,&#8221; neither of them
had ever heard, so that they had, as Miss Fisher put it
afterwards, &#8220;the time of their life.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they parted for the night, they decided to pay
a visit to the park in the morning and have luncheon
in the restaurant there, for old time&#8217;s sake, before taking
the train.</p>

<p>The day opened cold and blustering. But Margaret
saw in it a good omen. &#8220;Leave in rain and arrive in
sunshine,&#8221; she quoted from some hidden recess in the
treasury of her knowledge. But it didn&#8217;t prevent them
shivering in the park.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait until we get to New York. That&#8217;s the place
for sunshine, if you like. And not only sunshine, my
dear Helène, but a sunny life.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Helène, Bremen was a most bewildering place.
If it had not been for Margaret she would never have
known where to go or what to do first. But Margaret
knew everything. She saw that the tickets were correct,
saw to the tickets for the dock at Bremerhaven, had
their baggage carefully labeled and checked and wound
up at the big steamer as fresh as when they had left
Hanover. Immediately they boarded the vessel Margaret
saw to the stateroom, found out which side of
the ship was the sunny side and had their deck chairs
marked and placed there. She saw the chief steward
and arranged with him for good seats at the dining
table; she found the stewardess who was assigned to
their cabin and came to a satisfactory understanding
with her also.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, my dear Helène,&#8221; she explained to the
now utterly bewildered girl, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to live on
this boat for eight days. We&#8217;d better be comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
while we are here. We might be good sailors, and then
we might not. You never know. So it&#8217;s best to be
on the safe side. If either of us get seasick now,
that stewardess will look after us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great foghorn sent out a roaring sound that
seemed to Helène loud enough for the whole world to
hear. Clumsily, at first, the big ship moved, and then,
as she gathered headway, steamed out into the gray
expanse of the seeming boundless sea. Helène gazed
with bated breath and beating heart at the fast receding
land. There was no turning back now. She had indeed
burned her bridges. How would she fare in this
new land to which she was sailing?</p>

<p>A strong arm slipped round her waist and a warm
hand clasped hers in a firm, motherly grip. Margaret
had seen the expression on the poor girl&#8217;s face and had
come to give her comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear, dear, all will be well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène let her head fall on her friend&#8217;s ample breast
and looked up to the soft brown eyes that were so kind
in their meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a great comfort, dear friend. I shall always
love you, Margaret.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The voyage was calm and uneventful. The weather
was fine all the way and they enjoyed the eight
days on the Atlantic as though they were two school-girls
out on a vacation. On the morning of the
eighth day the good ship steamed majestically up
the Bay and landed the girls on the Jersey shore,
from whence Helène had a river view of New
York.</p>

<p>But the impressiveness of that sight was nothing to
her to the noise and rush of the city itself when she
found herself being carried rapidly on the street railroad.
A feeling of terrible depression came over her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
It was all so dirty, so uncouth, so raw. From all sides
came clanging of bells, shrieking of whistles, raucous
cries. A wretched drizzle was falling from a leaden
mist of sky. The people hustled and jostled each
other, hot and steaming from under waterproofs and
umbrellas. They seemed an endless stream of humanity
coming apparently from nowhere and going anywhere
and everywhere.</p>

<p>But to Margaret it was glorious. She sniffed the
raw, damp air and her cheeks glowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s good to be back! My proverb didn&#8217;t
hold out! We landed on a wet day after all. Well,
never mind. It&#8217;ll rain sunshine to-morrow. You
don&#8217;t mind, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Margaret. I think it&#8217;s wonderful.&#8221; What
traffic! What life! Her voice was drowned in the
thunder of trains rushing over their heads. They were
traveling along the avenue towards Margaret&#8217;s rooms.
Helène marvelled how the people could bear up under
such dreadful noises. Surely their senses must get
dulled and deadened in time! They crossed Broadway
at the risk of their lives, as it seemed to her, but Margaret
had Helène by the hand and laughed aloud.
Soon they entered a quiet square in the center of
which was a little park shut in by iron railings. Margaret
explained that this was Gramercy Park where
she lived.</p>

<p>Ascending the brown stone steps of a house near
the entrance to the square, Margaret pressed the bell
button. The door had barely opened when a loud,
glad exclamation greeted the two girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Fisher, I am so glad to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Jane! How are you? How&#8217;s Mrs. Kane?
Well? Ah, that&#8217;s good. Tell her I&#8217;ve brought a friend
who is going to stay with me. My room&#8217;s ready, I suppose?
Good. Well, we&#8217;re going upstairs, but we&#8217;ll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
down for lunch. I&#8217;ll be glad to see Mrs. Kane if she
can come up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then turning to Helène she smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along up, Helène. Our things won&#8217;t be here
for some time; but we&#8217;ll get along somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon they were joined by the landlady, a pleasant-faced,
middle-aged little woman with a gentle voice
and manner. She greeted Margaret affectionately and
shook hands with Helène on being introduced to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend will stay with me, Mrs. Kane, if you
don&#8217;t mind, until you can find her a room. Have you
one free?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Fisher, but it&#8217;s only the hall bedroom
on this floor. Will it do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it will. Fix it up for her, there&#8217;s a dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlady left, casting admiring glances at
Helène.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, dear&mdash;it&#8217;s to be Helen now, no French edgings
here, you know. Are you happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène for answer went up to Margaret and putting
her arms around her neck laid her head on the
tall girl&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too good to me, Margaret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret was deeply moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who could help being good to you, my dear,&#8221; she
said, stroking Helène&#8217;s hair.</p>

<p>When night came and Helène laid her tired head on
the soft pillow of her bed in the little hall-room, she
breathed a prayer of deep gratitude. Mr. Morton was
right. His country was God&#8217;s own country. Then
into her heart crept a feeling of sweet gladness. Perhaps&mdash;she
would meet him again&mdash;her knight, <i>sans
peur et sans reproche</i>. And, smiling, she slept.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">JOHN MORTON walked the windy deck of the
ship as though he were tramping all the way to
Europe. He counted the throbbings of the great
engine and the turns of the screws, so anxious and impatient
was he. The hours were like days and the days
like weeks.</p>

<p>Two months had passed since he had placed Helène
in Mr. Tyler&#8217;s care, and those two months had left their
marks on him. They had changed him from an adventurous,
happy young fellow into a sober, thoughtful
man. But while his brow had become lined his heart
still preserved its faith and hope. He had made up
his mind that he would seek out Helène and marry her
at once, if she would have him. During his enforced
absence in America he experienced so overwhelming
a desire that he could scarce restrain himself from
throwing everything up to satisfy his heart&#8217;s cravings
for a mere sight of her lovely face. In his thoughts
she stood out, by day and by night, as a thing for reverence
and worship.</p>

<p>Surely, by this time Don would have traced her; and
he pictured to himself the very place he would meet
her, how he would greet her, the lovely face as it would
look in response to his pleadings.</p>

<p>In Liverpool, disquieting telegrams and letters
awaited him. No trace of the Comtesse. The Princess
wrote to say that she knew nothing of Helène&#8217;s
whereabouts. She had left a short note on leaving
Weimar, but it contained no reference to where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
was going. She had drawn some money out of the
bank, and that was all she could learn there. Her maid
knew nothing definite.</p>

<p>Mr. Tyler had written in like manner. The police
of Dresden, Munich, Berlin and Vienna had been communicated
with, but with no results. Detectives had
been employed to no purpose. Helène seemed to have
disappeared from off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idiots!&#8221; muttered John in anger, &#8220;they couldn&#8217;t
find the Great Pyramid in a ten-acre lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Weimar he spent hours going over everything
with Donald; but what that faithful servitor reported
served only to deepen the mystery. One thing, however,
was clear&mdash;Helène had left in a very unhappy
state of mind.</p>

<p>He wrote an urgent note to the Princess requesting
an interview. The interview was a painful one to both.
The Princess broke down and bemoaned her bitter fate&mdash;her
inability to protect her friend. She told him
the whole story of the scene in the reception-room and
its cause.</p>

<p>Faugh! The thing was nauseating to John. What
a Court! What people these princelets were! He
guessed instinctively that it was Witherspoon who was
responsible for the article. He would settle with that
fellow another time. He left the Princess feeling no
great respect for her courage, and more resolved than
ever to leave no stone unturned.</p>

<p>And now he began a systematic hunt, on his own
account, throughout almost all Europe. Advertisements
were printed in the principal newspapers. Police
records and hotel registers examined, detectives employed.
Blue-eyed girls who read Helène&#8217;s description
in the advertisements dreamed thrilling romances and
envied the maid who, no doubt, was the heiress to some
enormously rich uncle. Girls with gray eyes thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
them blue and weaved tales of a Prince Charming
coming to set them free. Old maids sighed and old
men smiled. But, with all the interest that was excited,
and despite the lavish expenditure of money, the real
Helène remained undiscovered.</p>

<p>Weeks went by and Morton became very anxious.
He grew nervous and restless. As he walked the
streets he would examine every young woman he
passed with quick, furtive glances in the vain hope
that one of them might be Helène.</p>

<p>He consulted with Mr. Tyler frequently and that
wise man told him not to worry. The girl herself,
he felt sure, would write to him. John clung desperately
to this suggestion. He began calculating the time
it would take a letter to get back to him from America
should she have written him there. Judge Lowell had
his instructions and would cable him immediately on
its receipt. The thought calmed him greatly and he
thanked Tyler. He would wait in Weimar until the
end of February, by which time he reckoned a letter
might arrive in Cleveland.</p>

<p>Tyler&#8217;s judgment was justified. On the twenty-seventh
Morton received a cable from his lawyer informing
him that a letter from Germany had been
received and asking for instructions. He promptly
cabled back to open the letter and wire him the whereabouts
of the writer.</p>

<p>The answer came: &#8220;Party left for place not given.
Intends to remain hidden for some time. Is well.
Promises to write in good time. Copy mailed. My
advice not to worry. Family all well.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was nothing to do now but to wait. His
fears, it is true, were allayed, but how long would it
he before he would hear from her again? And what
should he do meanwhile? On referring his perplexity
to Tyler, that sensible man suggested that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
take a trip around Germany and look up his old haunts.
He decided to do this.</p>

<p>As there was now nothing which should keep McCormick
in Weimar, he sent him home, there to await
further orders. He himself went to Bonn, his Alma
Mater, and from there to Munich, where he renewed
his acquaintance with an assistant professor of philosophy,
whom he found happily married. This last visit
did him great good. The peaceful home of his old
tutor, where he stayed a few days, acted beneficially
on his nerves and gave him a taste of genuine happiness
which lasted him for many days.</p>

<p>But his restlessness returned. He could not reconcile
himself to patient waiting. His thoughts of Helène,
who was never entirely out of his mind, were
charged with anxiety about her welfare. She was so
inexperienced, so young, so beautiful that he felt she
would never be able to fight her way alone. He knew
how cruel the world could be to one of her sensitive
nature.</p>

<p>Obeying an irresistible impulse he suddenly took a
train for Vienna. It was there he had last seen Helène.
He stayed at the Bristol and idled his time wandering
aimlessly round the city pleasing himself with the
memories the place recalled. The son of Dan Morton
the pioneer was no longer the hard-headed man of
business. He had become nature&#8217;s child&mdash;the young
male longing for his mate. His mother was right;
there was more of the idealistic Randolphs than of the
practical Mortons in him. At the same time, his training
made him chafe because he could not accomplish
what he had set his mind on so determinedly. Then
the humor of the situation struck him and he laughed
aloud. It was a saving grace of a laugh; for it brought
back his common sense.</p>

<p>That evening, for the first time in many a day, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
dressed and went to the opera. He listened to &#8220;Romeo
and Julietta,&#8221; played by the splendid company of the
Imperial Court. He had an entrancing time. Juliet
was Helène and he Romeo. If only some kind-hearted
fairy could have whispered to him that the same strains
which were moving him to so exquisite a response
would, later, stir her heart strings in like wise! But
fairies have been banished from our sophisticated
world. Only children see them and hold communion
with them now.</p>

<p>From Vienna Morton went to Berlin and spent a
few days with the Tylers. They were glad to see him
looking so well and seeming more contented. &#8220;Youth
is a wonderful gift,&#8221; thought the old diplomatist, while
his wife could not resist saying to her husband: &#8220;What
a pity the girl is so silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last the long-looked-for letter arrived. John read
and reread it a dozen times, devouring every word and
examining each single sentence for some hint for which
his heart asked. He saw nothing to make him anxious,
but he realized now that he must respect her resolutions.
He gave up all further inquiries and search and
returned to New York, quietly resolved and happily
content to wait her own sweet pleasure. The fates
would be kind to him, he was sure.</p>

<p>When Morton returned to America, he found that
his mother and sister had gone South. He was not
sorry they were away, since it left him free to give his
entire thoughts and energies to the business&mdash;work,
downright hard work was the best medicine for a
mind distracted as his was. With Morton-like enthusiasm
he plunged into the maelstrom of the many
interests of his vast estates. He was at the office from
morning until, often, late in the evening, consulting,
directing, financing and operating. He took to the
game like a duck to water, and found a new interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
in its many-sided activities, and a new enjoyment in
meeting the men who were playing the game either
with him or against him. He was a king ruling a
mighty empire, the safety and integrity of which depended
largely on his wise judgment and decisive
action. The experience ripened him.</p>

<p>It was during this period that a letter came from
Mr. Tyler informing him that the Comtesse&#8217;s maid,
Josephine, had heard from her aunt, Anna Schreiber,
in Altenberg, giving important news concerning her
mistress. It appeared that Helène, after leaving the
Weimar Court, had stayed with her old nurse for some
weeks in the quiet little suburb. Helène had exacted
a promise from her nurse not to disclose her whereabouts;
but now that she had suddenly left her, Anna
had written to her niece to know if the Comtesse had
returned to Weimar. Tyler had immediately gone to
Altenberg to find out further details. He learned from
Mrs. Schreiber that Helène had left a note stating
that she was going to Munich; but on inquiry at the
railway station he was told that no ticket for Munich
had been sold on the day Helène had left. He concluded
by assuring Morton that he would let him know
if he learned anything of importance.</p>

<p>The receipt of this letter from Tyler threw John
back into his old state of anxiety and restlessness.
He absented himself from the office and spent the time
alone in his study brooding over what he should do.</p>

<p>His business associates could not understand him.
They had begun to admire the young man, and had
thought him a chip of the old block. He had taken the
reins with masterly hands and had proved himself a
worthy successor to the old man. But this sudden
change puzzled them.</p>

<p>With the approach of Easter Mrs. Morton and Ruth
returned and John joined them in a quiet hotel on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the avenue. The first breath of spring brought him
the news that Helène had been in Hanover, but had
left quite suddenly, no one knew where. Mr. Tyler,
who sent the information, wound up his letter by advising
John to give up troubling himself about the
girl. &#8220;It is evident,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;that she doesn&#8217;t want
you to find her. Give up this useless hunt and sit down
calmly and wait until she fulfills her promise to write
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>John smiled sadly as he read the well-meant advice.
It was all very easy to write those words, but to act
on them was not quite so simple. However, he made
up his mind.</p>

<p>That evening he dined at his club and utterly surprised
his friends by his liveliness and change of manner.
They didn&#8217;t recognize the Morton who chatted
to them in this free and easy way and told amusing
stories with the rest. It was his first plunge into a
sea of dissipation in which he swam as the mood seized
him, which it not unfrequently did. In a short time,
he was eagerly welcomed as &#8220;a sport&#8221; by those who
considered themselves of that select order of beings.
He went in for horses and fine carriages; gave sumptuous
dinners, attended race meetings, and became the
envy of the idle and the admiration of the foolish.
Well might his business friends wonder what had come
over John R. Morton!</p>

<p>His mother and sister were among the first to notice
the alteration in him. It distressed them deeply. The
two held a council of war and came to the conclusion
that John needed a change. Mrs. Morton suggested a
trip to Japan or papa&#8217;s hobby to convert the home on
the Hudson into a Versailles, or a yacht.</p>

<p>But Ruth, with the wisdom that comes early to
American maids, pursed her pretty lips and turned up
her impudent little nose at her mother&#8217;s ideas.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>&#8220;No, dear mamma, none of those things will do,&#8221;
she said decidedly. &#8220;John is in love. If he isn&#8217;t, he
ought to be. What we must do is to get him married.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton opened her eyes wide at her daughter&#8217;s
plain-spoken words. The precocity of the chicken
was amusing and yet, it seemed to her, on second
thought, that it hit the bull&#8217;s eye. The suggestion appealed
to her strongly, and the woman in the mother
could not resist the prospect of the peculiar pleasure
of match-making. Besides, it was time John married.
He was the head of the house.</p>

<p>Thus was formed the conspiracy in which two loving
women sought to undo all that the object of their
affection had been living for. Against such a combination,
the strongest man must of necessity be helpless.</p>

<p>The coming of the spring, therefore, found the Mortons
opening up their country residence on the Hudson.
Officially John was the master, but actually he
was a guest with the rest who were invited. The
place was ruled by Ruth through her mother.</p>

<p>Every evening when John came from business he
would find the house and its magnificent gardens and
terraces taken possession of by friends who had been
invited for a week or the week-end. Mostly these
were young women&mdash;friends of Ruth whom she had
known in college or had met at different seasons. He
was introduced to them all. Some he found interesting,
others amusing and others excellent companions
at riding, golfing or sailing. Before he had realized
it he began to look forward to these afternoons and
evenings on the river. The lovely spring weather,
too, acted on him like a tonic. He threw off his
moroseness and entered into the spirit of the healthy
gay life with all the gusto of youth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>Occasionally, he would ask his sister the meaning
of all this gayety and entertaining, but that young
woman would look at him innocently with round eyes
and would answer that she was just giving her friends
a good time and having one herself. If he wouldn&#8217;t
bring his friends, she had to bring hers. And Ruth
would leave him not a little puzzled and also not at
all displeased that things were as they were.</p>

<p>But if Ruth and her mother had expected that John
would fall a victim to the fascinations of one of the
many charming girls they had so cleverly placed in
his way, they were doomed to bitter disappointment.
He took things as he found them and enjoyed himself
to the full. But it never went further. The pretty
faces and alluring graces only served to remind him
more poignantly of &#8220;the girl he had left behind him.&#8221;
Helène&#8217;s sweet face, Helène&#8217;s blue eyes, Helène&#8217;s soft
voice, were always in his mind, and if he ever was
roused to a tender feeling for one of Ruth&#8217;s friends,
the vision of Helène would rise up and he would sigh
and turn away.</p>

<p>As the season advanced his mother and Ruth realized
that their scheme, like many others of &#8220;mice and
men,&#8221; had failed. It vexed Mrs. Morton and she took
occasion to vent her feelings to her son.</p>

<p>&#8220;John, what&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; she asked,
&#8220;why are you avoiding the girls who come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>John smiled and at once saw the meaning of the
house-parties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear mother, I&#8217;m not avoiding them. I&#8217;ve had a
delightful time, thanks to you and Ruth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you think, dear, it&#8217;s time you settled
down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s still time for that. I&#8217;m only thirty-three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father was married long before he was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
age. He used to say that it was to his early marriage
that he owed his success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear mother, but you forget he was very
lucky. There are not many girls like you in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very nice of you to say that, John, but you
know it&#8217;s no answer to my question. I am really serious.
I want you to get married. I want to see you
happy and the father of children. My old arms ache
to hold a grandchild.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good lady&#8217;s eyes filled with tears. John was
moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear mother, you&#8217;re the best mother in the world.
I&#8217;ll tell you the truth. I have not married because the
woman I love is lost to me. I met her in Europe, as
I told you, and she has disappeared. I&#8217;ve done all I
could do to find her, but without success. I am waiting
in the hope that I may meet her again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she, John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The most beautiful and the noblest girl in the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton smiled plaintively and nodded slowly
several times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, my dear, but who is she? The girl you
told me about when you came back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but please don&#8217;t press me for further particulars.
When I find her I will tell you. I hope with all
my heart she will have me. I know you will love her.
All I ask of you, dear mother, is to give me time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good lady was greatly moved by this display
of her son&#8217;s feelings. It was evident that this love
which possessed him was a very serious one. John
saw her anxiety and putting his arms round her shoulders,
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, dear, you will love her, too, I know. She
is just about Ruth&#8217;s age and the loveliest girl God ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
created. Won&#8217;t you, please, have faith in me? You
will not be disappointed. If I can wait, surely, you
can. Now, dear, just dry your eyes and believe that
I know what is best for my happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had to let the matter rest there. She told Ruth
it was useless for them to go on with their plans, because
John had plans of his own. An unfortunate remark
to make to Ruth since it acted like a match to
the dry tinder of her curiosity. Who was she? What
was she? Where was she? Where had he met her?
Where was she now? Would she meet her?</p>

<p>To all these questions Mrs. Morton could, of course,
give no answer. John had not told her. They must
wait his time. He did not himself know where she
was. He was hoping to find her.</p>

<p>Ah, then it was a real romance! How fascinatingly
interesting! And Ruth, afraid to question her brother
herself, gave free rein to her imagination. Nothing
but a princess would satisfy her ideas of what her
brother deserved. She must be the daughter of one
of the Balkan kings, and the lady had to wait until she
was called to the throne. She hoped, however, John
wouldn&#8217;t get mixed up in those wars there. Still, John
would know how to handle matters when once they
were put up to him. She didn&#8217;t mind what happened
so long as he would be happy. And, after all, it was
fine to have a brother who didn&#8217;t run after girls and
who gave his sister good times. Thus did Ruth reconcile
herself to the inevitable, like the practical philosopher
she was.</p>

<p>The summer found the Mortons at Newport. John
would come up for week-ends from the city and suffer
the boredom of the clubs. The men he met appealed
to him not at all; and a man can be no more
alone than when with his fellow-men if he declines to
live their lives. If, occasionally, he drifted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
rest, he did not drift far. His good sense, his self-esteem
and inborn dignity of character prevented him
from losing himself in vulgar pleasures or in seeking
a cheap notoriety.</p>

<p>The understanding he arrived at with his mother
had this one good effect&mdash;it recalled him to his better
self. He gave up his horses and avoided the &#8220;set&#8221; he
had come to know during his temporary lapse. He
went back to his business doubly determined to give
it his earnest thought and energies, and the dollars
kept rolling in. He became a recognized power in the
world of finance and people began to say of him that
&#8220;he beats the old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in the quiet of his own room, he would sit of
an evening alone engaged in what he smilingly said
to himself were &#8220;Hellenic studies.&#8221; Helène&#8217;s photograph&mdash;the
same he had received from Count Rondell&#8217;s
hand on that memorable interview on the steamer&mdash;was
never moved from his study table. The sweet
face looked out at him with all the power of its insistent
beauty. Why had he not carried her off at Vienna
and married her there and then? What a fool he had
been!</p>

<p>Now, all he could do was to wait. She had said
in her letter that she would write him again a year
hence. He read the letter again. No; it said, &#8220;when
autumn comes.&#8221; Ah, well&mdash;autumn was not so far
off. But oh, if he could but see her for just one minute!
He wondered if there was any truth in his friend,
Professor Guermot&#8217;s theory about thought transference.
If only he could send her a telepathic message
to say to her: &#8220;Helène, Helène, I love you. I am
waiting for you, dearest, with my heart in my hand.
Time is flying, and I want you&mdash;I want you.&#8221; Surely,
she was somewhere in this wide world where his impassioned
thoughts might reach her! Was she happy?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Was she well? Perhaps she was in distress and in
need! Damn money! Damn fame! If it hadn&#8217;t been
for that disgusting newspaper everything would have
been so different. Fate must have loaded the dice
against him, as though she had said to him: &#8220;Heads
I win, tails you lose.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MARGARET FISHER, the buxom chaperon
of Helène Barton, soon settled down to her
life in New York as she had planned it with
her friend in Hanover. The day following their landing
she was again in the spacious rooms of the Modiste
establishment known as &#8220;Lucile&#8217;s,&#8221; and, as of old, one
of its moving spirits.</p>

<p>As she had predicted, she found it no difficult matter
to interest Madame Lucile (a canny Scotchwoman
from Glasgow by way of Dublin and London and a
two years&#8217; sojourn in &#8220;Paree&#8221;) in her young protegée.
Madame no sooner set her shrewd eyes on Helène
than she became at once interested. She realized at a
glance the business possibilities in a girl of her refined
manners, winning ways and pretty foreign speech.
These qualities were certain to subdue the most petulant
and exacting of her clients. And when she found
that the girl also possessed both an excellent taste in
colors and an unusual gift for design, she knew that
a treasure had been brought to her.</p>

<p>Helène was installed in a little room at the rear devoted
to the assembling of the ornaments for the finishing
of those exclusive hats so coveted by the ladies
of New York, and it was not long before she became
indispensable to this department. Under her deft fingers
and with her enthusiastic good taste and happy
inspirations, lean old maids would be transformed into
blushing &#8220;buds,&#8221; and faded society leaders of many
seasons would reappear as enterprising and yet dignified
dames. She knew instinctively when to apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
velvet and where to mass flimsy, foamy billows. She
knew how to bend the brim of a hat so as to bring out
the good feature of a face; she would select just the
very sprig of flowers and give just the right droop of
plume; and she did it all with such grace, good-will
and a winning smile, accentuating her actions with
words spoken in so exquisite an accent, that there was
no resisting her. Margaret&#8217;s prediction came true; the
second month brought Helène an increase in her salary,
and she became the happy recipient of a hundred
dollars a month.</p>

<p>Helène (Madame had rebaptized her with the professional
Heloise, Helen not being, in her opinion, sufficiently
&#8220;French&#8221;), Madame Lucile determined, was
too valuable to lose. Rather than any rival concern
on the avenue should entice her from her she would
double the girl&#8217;s salary. But, of course, this was only
breathed to herself in the secrecy of her private office.</p>

<p>The two girls became closer friends than ever and
grew more and more attached to each other. Margaret,
in particular, seemed to have found in the
younger and more cultured Helène an object for the
satisfaction of her maternal instincts. No effort was
too great, no care too exacting, if only her little friend
was made the happier by it. She timed her lunch hour
to coincide with Helène&#8217;s; she accompanied her on her
shopping expeditions; she would take her away from
her designing and bring her home for rest. Rather
than Helène should go home alone, she would wait an
hour for her. At the Trust Company it was Margaret
who opened the bank account in her friend&#8217;s
name and deposited every Monday the little surplus of
wealth. She selected the style of her dresses and the
material; she fussed over them, sewed them, fitted and
trimmed them. She never tired of admiring the little
feet, the pretty hands and the wonderful hair. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
dressing of this hair for select occasions was one of
Margaret&#8217;s chief delights. If her &#8220;darling&#8221; had a
cold or a slight headache, she would nurse and pet her,
and be the happier in doing it.</p>

<p>And Helène would accept this devotion laughingly,
knowing that it was given in love, and would return
that love with sweet and gentle affection. She was
very happy both in her work, which was pleasant and
interesting, and in their rooms, which were cozy and
&#8220;homey.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the boarding-house Margaret Fisher was a general
favorite. Her ready good-humor, her quick wit
and her unaffected, if somewhat slangy, speech, always
found a ready acceptance and a responsive laugh. She
was ever ready with her help and sympathy, willing
to listen and equal to a gossip.</p>

<p>Helène&mdash;the beautiful, reserved, lily-like maiden&mdash;was
worshipped by all. From the scullery-maid with
the Kerry accent to Mrs. Kane, the kindly autocrat of
this little commonwealth, all bowed to her in delighted
homage. The women admired her without a taint
of jealousy; the two men who lived there reverenced
her from afar. She seemed to them like some rare lily
that had been transplanted into a city yard.</p>

<p>One of the men was a librarian at one of the city
colleges&mdash;a ripe, old scholar; the other, a young Baltimorean,
of a retiring manner, was struggling as an
obscure civil engineer. They considered themselves
fortunate to sit at the table and would gaze in awe on
the charming young foreigner&mdash;perfectly content to
behold her across the six feet of tablecloth. If either
ventured on a nearer acquaintance, he would find that
Miss Fisher had interposed her ample form between
them.</p>

<p>Helène had not imparted to her protectress much
more of her early life than had transpired at their meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
in Hanover and on the voyage across the ocean.
Margaret, in the confidential atmosphere engendered
by the close companionship, found the need of telling
her friend all about herself. It was a simple tale, but
the pathos of it drew a sympathetic response from her
listener.</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s father, an educated German of good
family, had come to America during the Civil War.
He had been compelled to leave the Fatherland because
of his activity in politics of a somewhat republican
tendency. In New York he became the city editor of
one of the more influential of the German newspapers.
It was during this period that he met and married a
German girl whose elder brother kept a small jewelry
and watch-repairing shop on the East Side. He was
a kind-hearted old bachelor and had been Margaret&#8217;s
earliest admirer and playmate.</p>

<p>It was to this uncle&#8217;s home above the store that she
and her mother went when her father died. A year
after her father&#8217;s death, when she was fifteen, Margaret
went to work at a dressmaker&#8217;s in the neighborhood.
They managed to get along very comfortably
together. Her uncle was kindness itself and a genius
at his trade. There was no style of watch or clock
he could not fix up and make keep correct time. He
was an expert at chronometer work and was regularly
consulted by captains of ships and even by the Navy
Yard.</p>

<p>Six years ago, Margaret&#8217;s mother died, leaving her
alone with her uncle. The old man had aged and
grown quite feeble then. He longed to go back to
Germany. So strong was this homesickness for his
beloved Harz Mountains that the doctor thought it best
to urge him to go. He went, promising to come back
soon, but he never returned. He died among the pine-clad
hills of his birthplace. The little property he left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
fell to Margaret and became the foundation for the
now greatly discussed bank account.</p>

<p>About three years after her mother&#8217;s death she met
a young man&mdash;a decent, quiet fellow, an assistant in a
drug-store. She liked him. He dressed well and was
very attentive and kind to her. A year later she consented
to become engaged to him. They were to be
married as soon as his employer had fulfilled his promise
to raise his salary and give him a percentage of
the business.</p>

<p>She was sure she did not love him; but she was in
no doubt that he needed some good, capable girl to
look after him. He was rather weak and vacillating;
but he was good-looking and any girl would be rather
proud to go out with him. Margaret put it that way,
because it really expressed her mind. She didn&#8217;t see
what else men were good for any way, except to be
mothered and to walk out with. It was nice for them
to take you out, and it felt good to have a man lean on
you and come to you for advice and the help that a
woman could give him.</p>

<p>Well, things went on very happily for some months
and then she noticed that he came less frequently to
the house. He would send notes instead, excusing
himself for one reason or another. One evening, when
she had stayed later than usual at the store to finish
some dresses for the Easter season, she went into
Krugler&#8217;s restaurant, at the corner of Second Avenue,
for her supper, and sat down near a slight partition or
screen of plants. She had scarcely begun her meal
when she heard a familiar voice from the other side
of the screen. Peering through the leaves of the palm
she saw her Bert seated at a table with a young woman.
He had his back to her, but she could hear quite distinctly
what he was saying. He was talking in the
most endearing words, exactly as he had talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to her. Then she heard the girl remind him of the
young lady&mdash;the serious girl with the money in bank&mdash;she
had seen him with. Wasn&#8217;t he engaged to be
married to her? He passionately protested. It was
not true, he said. He only loved her&mdash;the girl he was
with now. The other couldn&#8217;t compare with her. The
other was all right, but she had no heart&mdash;she was
always preaching and talking about getting on. Margaret
waited to hear no more. She had heard too
much as it was. The next day she returned him the
little gifts he had made her, including the engagement
ring, and when he called she declined to see him. Since
then she did not care to know any man. Of course,
Bert was no loss. She knew that now, but she had
liked him once. Oh, yes, men were all right in their
way; but a girl was far better off not to bother herself
about them. She&#8217;d get along just as well.</p>

<p>Helène kept a discreet silence as to her own opinions
on that subject. She was afraid to trust herself with
Margaret, least she might betray her own heart, and
Margaret never again broached the subject.</p>

<p>In their promenades together in the city what struck
Helène most was the people. Apparently all belonged
to the same class. All were so happy, so satisfied and
so well dressed. Each seemed to be going about his
own business without interference from others and yet
everybody was so orderly. It was all so different from
what she had been accustomed to in her own country.
No poverty, no soldiers, no armed policemen, no
officious park keepers, no bowing and scraping before
empty authority. Everybody was free to do as
he liked and yet everybody seemed pleased to be
decent and well-behaved. Even the children were unafraid.</p>

<p>In the park where she and Margaret found such enjoyment
in walking or sitting, the children would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
come up and look their frank admiration at Helène,
their eyes bright and their faces wreathed in smiles.
To Margaret the little ones crept instinctively. She
had such an inviting, motherly look about her that
they knew no introduction was necessary for them to
be taken into her embracing arms. It did Helène&#8217;s
heart good to watch Margaret&#8217;s keen delight on these
occasions.</p>

<p>Helène could have had no wiser guide than this
friend proved to be. Margaret Fisher was a genuine
native of New York, bred in its peculiar ways of life,
which were at once the outcome of sharp competition
and bonhomie. She seemed to have the wisdom of
the serpent and the innocence of the dove. Her inexhaustible
supply of wit, her humorous way of seeing
things, her happy, healthy nature, gave everybody who
came under her influence a sense of the reasonableness
and fitness of things. &#8220;You can&#8217;t help being in a
good humor when Miss Fisher is around,&#8221; Mrs. Kane
truly said.</p>

<p>In the daily companionship of such a teacher Helène
ripened in experience. Without acquiring the slang
spoken everywhere about her, she obtained a command
of English which was at once smooth and polished,
though she never lost her quaintly pretty accent. Her
own instinct guided her and her refinement of nature
compelled from others a response which avoided the
vulgar. People felt they must be different with
Helène, so that they chose their words in speaking
to her. They felt they must be on their best behavior
with her.</p>

<p>Spring grew into summer, the more than benevolent
summer of New York. The girls in Madame Lucile&#8217;s
employ blossomed in colors and gowns befitting the
season; but Helène made no change in her own dress.
She retained her sombre black despite Margaret&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
pleadings and Madame&#8217;s hints. And with it all she
bloomed like a rare flower amid the commoner plants.
Margaret would put on an air of chagrin and talk
of the anxiety Helène was to her; but none the less
she was exceedingly proud of her protegée. To her
friends she would in mock despair say: &#8220;What chance
has any girl with Helène, I should like to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>On their occasional visits to Art Exhibitions or
the Museum, the old librarian was proud to act as
cicerone. He had become the envy of the rest in the
boarding-house, and especially of the young engineer,
because of this privilege extended to him. He had
even acted as their host on two occasions when they
had accepted his invitation to partake of a table d&#8217;hôte
dinner at a French restaurant.</p>

<p>The Baltimorean listened to the recital of the enjoyment
and waited patiently for his turn. He proved a
good waiter. On the eve of the Fourth of July, he
ventured to ask the two girls to go with him to the
beach. Robert McCreedy could hardly believe his
ears when his invitation was accepted. He made a
careful estimate and concluded that a week&#8217;s income
would about meet the occasion, and prayed that the
day would be fine.</p>

<p>The day broke cloudless with a pitiless sun blazing
down. McCreedy was happy. He did not know that
the effect of the sweltering heat of the past few days
on Helène had more to do with Margaret&#8217;s acceptance
of the invitation than anything else. He thought that
his patience had at last been rewarded; that the implacable
duenna had thought it well to permit him a
nearer access to the object of his devotions.</p>

<p>To Helène, tired and overcome by the oppressive
heat, the day proved a boon and was also an experience
of a novel kind. The ride to the Battery; the ferry
trip to South Brooklyn; the open, swaying cars of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
steam railway to the beach; the beauty of the Long
Island landscape; the cool breezes of the rolling ocean&mdash;all
were new to her and afforded such interest and
refreshment that she forgot her weariness of brain
and body and gave herself up to the enjoyment with
the abandon of a girl. Everywhere were men, women
and children on pleasure bent. Everybody seemed
happy. She had already learned many a lesson from
this wonderful democracy, but none appealed to her
so strongly as did this celebration. A great humanity
had assembled, as if at the call of some mysterious
voice, and here they were laughing, playing, singing,
care-free and happy, without a sign or a sound of discord&mdash;all
members of a national family, as it were.
This, indeed, was a new world&mdash;new in a sense that
her people in Roumelia could never understand. It
was a revelation of the human heart, an insight into
the meaning of life which was denied to those who
have not known true liberty and have not been permitted
the free play of their finer natures.</p>

<p>The day came to a close but too quickly for Robert
McCreedy. He had spent his wealth gladly and had
known a happiness he had never known before. When
Margaret, after consulting her watch, announced it
was time to go home, he looked his disappointment so
openly that Margaret was compelled to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. McCreedy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but we must
really get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>McCreedy knew, from her tone of voice, that there
was no appeal. He must content himself with the
favor that had been granted him. In the seclusion of
his room, later, he relived his happy day. He would
see her again to-morrow. Sufficient for the day was
this joy thereof. After all, the ice had been broken
and some day he might get the opportunity to take
her out alone&mdash;without that dragon of her friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Poor fellow! What dreams he permitted himself! In
the hour or two before retiring he had become so rich
that he was sailing in his own yacht with Helène,
happy and radiant, by his side on the deck. And when
he slept he dreamed of a magnificent home with splendid
salons through which Helène &#8220;walked in beauty
like the night,&#8221; and he by her side.</p>

<p>Margaret had long suspected McCreedy&#8217;s state of
heart, and had taken care to keep him from Helène as
much as possible during the day. As she sat now,
with Helène, in their sitting-room, she looked at the
girl for a sign of resentment at her manoeuvres. But
she saw nothing but the evidences of the happy time
she had had.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of Mr. McCreedy?&#8221; she
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very nice. He was so kind and attentive,
wasn&#8217;t he? I hope he didn&#8217;t spend more than he could
afford.&#8221; Margaret smiled. Her lessons in economy
had borne fruit in Helène&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess he wouldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, perhaps not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène spoke the last words listlessly. The reference
to money sent her mind reflecting on her own
life. She was so anxious to save as much money as
she could spare. If Mr. Morton should come, she
would then be in a position to pay him back all that
he had spent on her. And autumn would soon be
here, when she must fulfill her promise to write to
him. What would he say when he saw her again?
Ah&mdash;but would he come? Cleveland&mdash;eight hundred
miles away&mdash;did people ever travel that long distance
to come to New York? And if he came, he surely
would approve!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, honey, you&#8217;re not listening to me. I declare
you&#8217;ve been in a trance for the last five minutes.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Margaret assumed an offended air. Helène
started and blushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now come, what were you thinking of? I have
an idea there&#8217;s a Count or a Prince buzzing in your
little head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, there is neither Count nor Prince. I was
thinking of my old home. I daren&#8217;t think of men
with a man-hater like you near me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t press you, my dear. But I&#8217;m not a
man-hater,&#8221; and Margaret&#8217;s voice softened. &#8220;I sometimes
think it would do me good to have a man to fuss
about and look after. Men are such helpless things.
They wobble from one pretty girl to another, and I
believe they can&#8217;t help it. What they want is some
woman to mother them. I really think I would want
to mother a man just as I want to take care of babies,
and as I love to take care of you, dearie!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène looked at her friend. Poor, lonely Margaret,
she thought, God had made her to be a mother.
The revelation into her friend&#8217;s soul was too sacred
to speak about. With instinctive courtesy she changed
her tone covering what she had seen with a veil of
light words:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure, Margy dear, there are men who are not
what you call &#8216;wobblers.&#8217; I haven&#8217;t known many, but
I&#8217;m convinced there are loyal and true men. My
father was one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no answer to that, Helen. I believe it. But
as there are not many girls like you, there cannot be
many men like your father was. Well, dear, it&#8217;s getting
late and we ought to be in bed. To-morrow will
be another &#8216;scorcher,&#8217; and we have the new models to
go over. And this weather doesn&#8217;t improve the dispositions
of the women who want to wear corsets
two sizes too small for them&mdash;like Madame Lucile
does.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>Helène laughed. &#8220;Now you are not just to her.
I don&#8217;t think she does that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you, sweetheart? Well, never mind, I know
better. A woman would be anything rather than fat.
Why, even I am sometimes afraid to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Margy, how can you! You are not a bit
stout, only big and strong. Everybody admires you,
and Madame is always praising your fine figure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an angel, my dear, and wouldn&#8217;t hurt the
feelings of a tax-collector. Give me a kiss, my dear,
and good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, Margy, and thank you for the happy
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in such intimate talks that Margaret, the
strong, protecting tree to the slender vine, Helène,
proved her friendship. In breeding and education the
two girls were poles apart, but the native virtues and
sterling character in each drew them together in an
abiding love. A daughter of the people and a child
of an ancient nobility thus met on the ground of their
common humanity. With the passing of the days,
Helène found new interest in her work and became
more accustomed to the new life. Margaret, seeing
Helène&#8217;s happiness, was happy herself. Sunshine
without and contentment within, with not a cloud on
the horizon of their lives!</p>

<p>Petty incidents like these may seem unworthy of
record; but life is made up of such small happenings.
Most of us come into this world and flit more or less
swiftly and pleasantly through the playground of our
childhood and youth as though it were but the antechamber
to some richly furnished parlor. When we
enter the longed-for parlor, we find in it labor and
sorrow in plenty. We eat, sleep, dream, enjoy ourselves
a little and then one day we awaken to the
sad reality that we are no longer young. Some kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
friend will remark: &#8220;Why, your hair is growing
gray!&#8221; Another will sympathize and say: &#8220;Ah, we
are not as young as we used to be.&#8221; He uses the polite
plural, but we know he has a very definite singular in
mind. And then comes the day when the roomy arm-chair
is inviting, and the favorite ballad which once
whispered gladness, now only recalls times long, long
past. Then it is that the chatter of youth is a forgotten
language; that the faces of women show only
the rouge on cheek and lip and not the glorious eye;
when an invitation to the dance compels us to the confession,
&#8220;I am too old to dance,&#8221; and to the thought,
&#8220;did she really want me for a partner?&#8221; when our
conversation slips into the question, &#8220;do you remember?&#8221;
when the past is our present and the future a
dread. Ah, if youth knew the fulfillment of the promises
of life, would he or she be gay? It is in our memory
that we live, and memory is but the storehouse of
little incidents. They are the little colored stones,
which form the mosaic background of life. The figures
may vary, the genre may change, but the background
is always the same.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE halcyon days of that summer were filled
with work and innocent enjoyment for Helène
and Margaret. The girls were so happy that
the gods themselves must have become envious, for
they sent one of their number to destroy their happiness.</p>

<p>On days when the heat was oppressive, the girls
left their work at an earlier hour than usual and
would then walk along Fifth Avenue. At that hour
the streams of people from shops and business places
mingled with the current of those on pleasure bent.
In crossing the thoroughfare, Helène and Margaret
got stalled. Helène, undecided whether to advance
or return, became confused and before she realized
it a pair of spirited horses in an open landau was
almost on top of her. Margaret seeing the danger,
rushed up and pushed her into safety. In doing so,
however, she herself was caught by the pole of the
carriage, and thrown down and trampled on by one of
the horses.</p>

<p>A crowd gathered immediately and Margaret, now
unconscious, was carried to the sidewalk. Helène,
deathly pale and speechless with horror, held the
bleeding head of her beloved comrade in her lap. A
policeman who had promptly arrived on the scene
rushed to ring for an ambulance, when a richly
dressed lady of commanding appearance offered to
drive the young woman to the nearest hospital. She
was the occupant of the carriage which had been the
cause of the accident. Willing bystanders, assisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
by the officer of the law, lifted the lifeless form into
the landau into which Helène was invited by the
owner.</p>

<p>At the hospital Helène was not allowed to go into
the ward, but was requested to await the doctor&#8217;s report
in the waiting-room. Almost beside herself with
anxiety, she sat in a stupor and could scarcely answer
the usual questions put to her by the doctor in charge.</p>

<p>The lady in whose carriage she had come, sat
mutely near the window nervously tapping the sill,
staring absently into the court without. Some questions
were put to her also, but she, too, was too overcome
to answer coherently.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, a terribly long time to Helène,
the nurse returned and whispered that her friend was
resting in bed and that a cursory examination had
revealed no serious injuries. The head physician
would be in shortly and would make a more thorough
examination. She could wait until then, Helène was
told. The other lady was given the same information.</p>

<p>The strain of her pent-up feelings relieved by the
nurse&#8217;s report, Helène broke into sobs. She thanked
God in her heart that her dear Margaret would not
die as she had feared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, miss,&#8221; came a sympathetic voice, &#8220;can
I be of any help to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène looked up and recognized the dignified lady
in whose carriage she had been driven to the hospital.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to learn that your friend is not seriously
hurt. I am Mrs. Van Dusen. It was my carriage that
was the cause of the unfortunate accident to your
friend. Won&#8217;t you let me help you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mrs. Van Dusen, but I am scarcely
able to think. If my friend, Miss Fisher, is not very
badly injured I should like to take her home. It was
my fault....&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>Helène broke down, the tears choking her voice.</p>

<p>The unusual beauty, the sweet, refined voice and
manner of the young woman impressed the lady.
She sat down near Helène and said in kindly
tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not distress yourself, my dear. Your
friend will be well taken care of here. I will see to
that. I am deeply grieved the accident occurred. I
saw you and your friend step right in front of the
horses and called out to the coachman; but it was too
late. I want to do all I can to help Miss Fisher. Has
she any relatives or friends who ought to be notified?
My son is outside and he will gladly take any message.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has no friend other than myself. For her
sake I shall be glad to accept any assistance you can
give me. It was in saving me that she got hurt herself.
Oh, my poor lovely Margaret....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, my dear, it is not so bad after all.
Compose yourself. Here comes the nurse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse informed Helène that Miss Fisher was
conscious and the doctor would allow her to see her
friend for a minute&mdash;but she must not be excited.</p>

<p>Helène rose eagerly and walked rapidly into the
ward. Behind a screen, on a narrow cot, Margaret
lay white and helpless. Her head was heavily bandaged
so that only her eyes showed. On seeing
Helène, she smiled wistfully into the face that was
bending over her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, darling! I&#8217;m all right&mdash;only a little
bruised. I&#8217;ll be out in no time. Wasn&#8217;t it lucky?
But who&#8217;s going to look after you while I&#8217;m here,
little one?&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse approached and whispered to Helène:
&#8220;Just say a few kind words for the present. You can
come another time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Margaret, I&#8217;m so happy to see you. Don&#8217;t
worry about me, dearest. I&#8217;ll come and look you up
as often as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret looked back her content; she was too ill
to speak.</p>

<p>The nurse touched Helène on the arm. It was time
to leave. Kissing the pale lips, she retired slowly,
looking back at the wan face until the door had been
closed on her.</p>

<p>In the waiting-room she found a tall young man
by the side of Mrs. Van Dusen.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my son,&#8221; said the lady to Helène, &#8220;he will
take any message, Miss&mdash;eh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Miss Barton. Thank you, there is
no message I wish sent. I shall wait here for the
physician&#8217;s report. I will tell Madame Lucile, myself,
later.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tall, carefully groomed and good-looking
young man approached, hat in hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me, Miss Barton, to go to her for you. I
have a carriage waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; but it will be better if I see the
lady. Madame Lucile is our employer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is my card, Miss Barton,&#8221; said Mrs. Van
Dusen. &#8220;Let me know if I can be of any service. I
shall inquire regularly at this hospital and my son will
see the superintendent and arrange that special attention
be given Miss Fisher. I am deeply grieved at
the accident and hope sincerely that Miss Fisher will
not suffer. Good-bye, Miss Barton. Are you coming,
Howard?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man came up to Helène and said in a
kind voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me for suggesting it, Miss Barton, but
you ought to consult a lawyer on this matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Howard, what do you mean?&#8221; exclaimed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
mother angrily. &#8220;What should Miss Barton consult
a lawyer about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mother, Miss Barton&#8217;s friend may suffer in
other ways than from the injuries she has received.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, I am not going to shirk any responsibility.
The young lady has my card. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget, Miss Barton, to let my mother know.
May I have your address?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Van Dusen, there is no necessity
for that. Good afternoon, madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother and son had no sooner left than the nurse
came in bringing the physician in charge. Dr. Loomis
relieved the girl&#8217;s mind by telling her that her Miss
Fisher was in no danger. She would remain for the
present in the ward until she had recovered sufficiently
from the shock. No bones had been broken, but the
bruise on the head was rather severe. Every care
would be given her friend. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be anxious, my
dear young lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we shall get her quite well
again. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse informed Helène that she could visit her
friend every day and that Mrs. Van Dusen, who was
a patroness of the hospital, had left word that the
patient should be most carefully attended to. Helène
thanked the woman.</p>

<p>From the hospital she hurried to Madame Lucile&#8217;s
home and was greatly relieved that the lady took the
news as she did. Madame promised to look after
everything. Helène, for the first time since she had
been in America, went home alone.</p>

<p>And now began the trying and anxious time.
Every day Helène called at the hospital, but was not
permitted access to the sick-room. Margaret had an
attack of brain fever and could recognize no one. She
would leave for Madame Lucile&#8217;s in tears. There she
worked for two to drown her anxiety. But the lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
evenings and tearful nights followed and they had to
be borne by herself alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Dusen had called on Madame Lucile and
had offered to defray the expenses; but Helène firmly
refused to accept the offer. Margaret and she could
afford to pay them themselves.</p>

<p>Whenever Helène visited the hospital, she would
find Mr. Van Dusen waiting, ready with a courteous
request to be of service, and repeated the offer his
mother had made to Madame Lucile. But Helène
declined both. On one occasion he asked permission
to call on Miss Barton. This she also declined. When
Margaret recovered from the fever, he sent her
flowers almost daily. Twice Helène received a large
box of beautiful lilies at the boarding-house with his
card. She wrote him a polite note of thanks in which
she told him that she would take the flowers to
Margaret.</p>

<p>At the end of three weeks, Margaret was declared
to be out of all danger. Her wounds had healed and
the bandages had been removed. On the left temple
showed a livid scar, but the nurse assured Helène
that this would disappear in time. In a week Margaret
would be allowed to go home; but the doctor
advised a rest at the seashore or in the mountains before
returning to work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Dusen claimed the right to provide for
this rest, at least, and begged Margaret to accept the
hospitality of her country place in the Kittatinnies,
which was only an hour&#8217;s ride from New York, and
where the mountain air was cool and invigorating.
&#8220;I have been so unhappy, Miss Fisher,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;about the accident, and you&#8217;ve let me do nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret compromised by agreeing to stay at a
farm-house near Mrs. Van Dusen&#8217;s place and to use
that good lady&#8217;s carriage. But she insisted on paying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
for her board. Mrs. Van Dusen was only too
glad that she had been able to prevail over Margaret&#8217;s
independent spirit to that extent. Her visits to the
hospital had made her acquainted with the girl&#8217;s fine
nature, both in the courage she had evinced in pain,
and in the devotion she showed to Helène. Mrs. Van
Dusen could not help but look up to so grand and yet
so finely democratic a character.</p>

<p>In the younger girl, with the gentle, well-bred
bearing which, as she readily saw, but veiled the reticence
of inborn dignity, she had found a rare personality.
A girl entirely aloof from her surroundings
and who was yet self-supporting and happy in the
small circle of her life. Mrs. Van Dusen, the society
leader and proud wife of one of the wealthy men of
New York, could not fail to see that this simple, dignified
girl was her equal in everything but worldly gifts.
She tried hard to pierce the armor of modesty and
unselfishness in which the girl clothed herself; but its
very inoffensiveness proved it to be a stronger protection
than anything else could have been.</p>

<p>Her son, Howard, had confessed to her that the
younger of the two girls had made a deep impression
on him, but, he ruefully added, &#8220;I&#8217;ve not made much
headway with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Helène, the American custom which permitted a
young man and girl to meet and converse freely and
alone, was one which she either did not understand or
did not approve. Van Dusen&#8217;s escort to the boarding-house
was rather suffered than accepted. Upon arriving
at the home, she would bid him good-bye, and
take no notice of his hints for an invitation to call.
His floral gifts she invariably transferred to Margaret.
He had to admit frankly that he had not made a very
favorable impression. His mother wisely said
nothing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>At the Post&#8217;s farm-house Margaret found herself
comfortably established on the second floor. She
wrote every day to Helène glowing accounts of the
beautiful country and urged her to come and visit
her for a few days. The people were nice and kind
and there was a quaint room which she could have
all to herself. She was getting quite strong again and
had acquired a tremendous appetite. She pleaded so
earnestly that Helène finally agreed to go if Madame
Lucile gave the permission.</p>

<p>Certainly the prospect of a vacation did look alluring.
She had been working hard during Margaret&#8217;s
illness and had been very lonely and depressed
in spirits. She had even denied herself the few hours
of relaxation she had enjoyed when Margaret was at
home, and had kept herself confined during the hottest
days&mdash;a trying ordeal to anyone living in New York,
and especially so to a foreigner.</p>

<p>The canny lady from Glasgow was too pleased to
extend a vacation to Mademoiselle Heloise, and thus it
happened that by the Saturday before Labor Day
Helène had made all her preparations and was ready
for the great event.</p>

<p>As she was utterly ignorant of ways and means,
Mr. Diderot, the fatherly librarian, was duly impressed
to act as escort to the dreaded Terminal and
Ferry. Mrs. Kane, with many motherly admonitions,
kissed her good-bye and put her in charge of her elderly
lodger. The old gentleman, proud of his duty, had
spruced himself up and assuming a youthful gait,
walked vigorously by her side carrying the suit-case.
His hailing of the street car was done with a dignity
which can be compared only to the bearing of the
Mayor escorting the President of the United States
to the City Hall.</p>

<p>In the waiting-room at the Ferry, Helène was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
to sit in the cool protection from the heat while Mr.
Diderot negotiated the various transactions necessary
to obtaining the ticket and checking the baggage for
the particular place in the New Jersey vastness to
which his charge was bound. The crowd of people
hurrying here, there and everywhere, so bewildered
the poor girl that she hardly dared to lift her eyes.
She almost regretted her step in taking such a long
journey alone into an unknown country.</p>

<p>At last her escort returned. She rose eagerly and he
led her into the pushing crowd where she was gently
propelled through a narrow strait flanked by two
sharp-eyed men armed with shining punchers, into a
spacious room filled with a motley assortment of
people of both sexes and all ages.</p>

<p>A slight shock followed by a tremor through the
wood flooring startled Helène. But Mr. Diderot explained
that she need not be afraid&mdash;it was only the
arrival of the ferry-boat. At the opened gateway, he
handed her the ticket for Charlotteville and wishing
her a pleasant journey he bowed in his punctilious way
and left her to the mercy of the crowd that soon
pushed her on to the boat. What a hurrying and scurrying
and jostling and hustling! Men with packages
and suit-cases, women with suit-cases and packages
and children; men with golf bags and women with
dogs; children clinging frantically to their mothers&#8217;
skirts&mdash;all perspiring and all craning their necks to
swallow the river&#8217;s breeze, thankful of this respite
from the city&#8217;s heat.</p>

<p>A clanking of bells, a shrill, long-drawn whistle, a
clinking of chains and she was off&mdash;off on her wonderful
journey across the majestic river to the hazy,
mysterious shore of Jersey&mdash;her first travels into
America. She gazed about her at the people sitting
on the low seats and standing in the doorways; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
seemed to her to be different from those she had met
in New York. The men were so important, the
women so self-conscious and the children so droll.</p>

<p>Through the open windows shone the reflection
from the waters of the river, the waves of which
sparkled in the sunlight. Busy little tugs saucily
stretched their prows; cumbersome ferry-boats glided
past as mountainous shadows. The fresh air and the
wide expanse gave her a sense of assurance. She
decided to risk the outside platform.</p>

<p>As she stood up to go out a sudden recollection
made her start. Where was her suit-case? For a
moment she felt as if her heart was sinking; but the
next moment she gave a sigh of relief as she remembered
that Mr. Diderot had &#8220;checked&#8221; the case to
Charlotteville. She felt for the precious pasteboard
in her handbag and smiled when she found it was
safely there.</p>

<p>On the platform without she looked about her
drinking in the wonderful expanse of water and free
air and blue sky. The great river with its baggage and
floats, tugs and steamers, sailing vessels and a big liner
steaming slowly down towards the Bay, little launches
and graceful yachts, appeared to her like the river of
life itself. Looming up and drawing nearer and
nearer, the cavernous train-shed flanked by stupendous
grain elevators, looked to her like gigantic fortifications
guarding and preventing a possible entry into
the green country beyond. Where did the railroad
begin, she wondered?</p>

<p>And now the people began their jostling and hustling
once more. Packages were seized and children
grabbed at the sound of the clanking of chains and the
turning of windlass. Then came the rattling of iron
gates being opened and the living stream poured itself
on to the land.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>For a moment she looked about her, bewildered,
but seeing a uniformed individual, she plucked up
courage to ask him the way to her train. He scarcely
deigned to notice her, but with a motion behind him
he said: &#8220;Track number four to your left.&#8221; Helène
was no wiser, but she dared not risk another inquiry
and walked with the crowd. She heard a benevolent
looking elderly person in a magnificent uniform and
gold-laced cap singing out some words she could not
understand. She found her courage, however, and
put her inquiry to him. To her relief he led her to
the car and even assisted her to mount the steps. The
quick transition from the outer glare to the dark interior
caused her to falter; but seeing that other people
were making free with the cushioned seats, she
chose one for herself opposite a wholesome looking,
stout lady and a small girl. She was too timid to
look about her and was almost afraid to return the
happy smile of the little child across the aisle. At
last came the long cry &#8220;All aboard,&#8221; followed by a
hissing noise and the train&mdash;her train&mdash;moved slowly
out.</p>

<p>She was really on her great journey! As the
engine gained headway the train passed the pillars
along the track and dived into a cavernous deep cut
on to a long trestle over the housetops. Then winding
its way between simmering and smoky factories,
past ugly board fences and stretches of open land
covered with rubbish, it thundered over a bridge spanning
a broad expanse of muddy water. Round a
sharp curve with a shriek as if of desperation, and
there she was in a lovely meadow gleaming green in
the sunlight, the reeds and the bulrushes waving in
the breeze&mdash;the country! America&mdash;the long sought
for land of romance&mdash;the New World!</p>

<p>Her heart beat with the excitement of the rush, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
eyes fixed on the swiftly moving landscape. The
deep rose color of the giant mallows enlivens the sage
green of the reeds; narrow veins of tidewater wend
their courses with almost geometrical directness
through the dark muck of the salt meadows; in the
distance are seen the rounded humps of dwarfed
hills and the tall smoke-stacks of factories. Then another
river is crossed&mdash;a broad stream with shallow
barges loaded with crimson bricks and yellow clay.
The landscape gradually changes to cultivated farmlands.
Clumps of trees, cottages and cows&mdash;real live
cows grazing along the hedgerows&mdash;appear and disappear.
Through the opening in the foliage are seen
small villas and occasionally more pretentious houses;
lawns and stone walls; highways with carriages and
bicycles. Another rush into a deep cut walled in with
rocks and then a gentle gliding into the open revealing
a hilly country with houses, gardens, rows of trees and
avenues. With a rumble, a short bridge over a stream
traversing a deep green pasture is crossed and the
train rushes through a quiet street. Out of the village
with a noise as of many waters and into another
cut flanked by a rocky ledge dripping with moisture
and overhung with brambles that almost brush the
windows of the cars. Then once more into the open,
rolling land.</p>

<p>On and on, northward, the train speeds. Now and
again it stops at some small station with a grinding
noise and, after a few passengers alight, the engine
bell rings once more, the hissing of the brakes deafens
the ear, and with hoarse puffs and groans, it is off
again, squeaking, bumping, swaying with dust and
cinders floating and flying into the cars.</p>

<p>It is all a stunning, bewildering, amazing and wonderful
experience to Helène. She finds herself speculating
as to what will come next, hoping it won&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
last long, and wishing it wouldn&#8217;t be over quickly.
She is under the fascinating spell of quick motion
through space and is in a continual tremor of excited
anticipation.</p>

<p>And now, all at once, the landscape changed entirely.
Beautiful valleys, fine streams shaded by
giant trees, broad fields, endless levels of tasseled
maize moving in the wind passed by her like a swiftly
moving panorama. The hills became more abrupt,
the mountains shut out the horizon. Houses were
now fewer and smaller. The mirror of a lake
gleamed between dark foliage. A weather-beaten gray
structure resembling a wrecked whaler, though it was
only an ice-house, causes Helène to start back as its
black shadow darkened the windows. Then came a
grinding of iron wheels on the metal, a creaking
and a scraping, the train began to slow down, and
with a shock it pulled up at the station&mdash;Charlotteville.</p>

<p>She doesn&#8217;t realize that this is her goal until the
conductor speaks to her and a begrimed brakeman
grabs her bags with a &#8220;your station, miss.&#8221; Helène
follows with a sinking of the heart and is left, standing
forlorn on the hot, dried boards of the platform,
contemplating a number of boxes, trunks, plows and
lawn-mowers which lie around. She gazes after the
fast disappearing train utterly at a loss what to do or
where to turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be ye lookin&#8217; for somebody, miss?&#8221; The question
came to her in a quavering, falsetto voice.</p>

<p>Turning quickly she beheld a whiskered nondescript
of a man looking at her with shrewd eyes and
a dry smile on his thin lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;Mr. Post was to meet
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess, it&#8217;s Bill Post ye mean, miss. Thar&#8217;s his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
team&mdash;that sorrel over yonder. I guess I&#8217;ll tell
Artie.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Bill Post&#8217;s team all right&mdash;the large blondish
horse of the breed of hard working cousin of a
percheron and a box-like wagon on the driver&#8217;s seat
of which a boy of tender years with the face of a
Methuselah, sat humped. The whiskered owner of
the falsetto voice deposited Helène&#8217;s valise on the
tailboard of the wagon and helped her to a seat by
the side of the silent and prematurely aged Artie who,
without opening his lips or moving a facial muscle,
gave a peculiar chuckle, and the noble steed was off
at a heavy, leisurely amble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Git ap, Major!&#8221; came from the tightly closed lips
of the boy, and at a slightly faster gait they skirted
the long, rambling frame building with the sign,
&#8220;John P. Brown&#8217;s Hotel,&#8221; the guests of which on the
stoop stared inquiringly after the ill-assorted pair on
the wagon. Next came an unpretentious structure
greatly in need of the painter&#8217;s services bearing the
legend, &#8220;Post Office.&#8221; Passing this they entered a
gray highway, bordered with dust-covered bushes and
weeds.</p>

<p>The first part of the drive lay across an unattractive
stretch of level fields baked hard by months of
constant sunlight, the green of the sparse vegetation of
which seemed as though it were struggling hard to
overcome the all-enveloping gray. The air vibrated
with the heat and was laden with floating particles of
dust. Helène&#8217;s spirits sank. Was this the beautiful,
wild rural America? Her eyes were smarting and
her throat parched and itching. Suddenly the vehicle
turned round a sharp bend in the dust-covered road
to a short bridge with a somewhat elevated approach.</p>

<p>What a miraculous change! And oh, what a blessed
relief! Under the rattling boards of the bridge ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
swiftly the most refreshing of clear waters on which
graceful fronds floated and trembled in the current.
The banks of this stream were fresh in green and
resplendent in the gay colors of flowers. A little beyond
the road were deep shadowy woods of giant
trees with moss-covered trunks. The bright foliage
was altogether free of the oppressive dust. The brilliant
yellow of the golden-rod vied with the heliotrope
and the purple of wild asters to form a charming
foreground inviting to the shady depths beyond.
Helène was enchanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the name of this pretty stream?&#8221; she
risked in her meekest and softest of tones. She was
really afraid to speak to this boy of twelve, with the
serious immobile face that appeared so supernaturally
indifferent to mere worldly things. It was almost a
sacrilege to disturb so calm and superior a being.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pequannock.&#8221; And then, as if he had condescended
too greatly, &#8220;Git ap, Major!&#8221; The rest was
silence.</p>

<p>But the ice was broken, for when they passed an
opening in the wood which showed a large house with
broad, sloping lawns in front of it, he volunteered the
information, &#8220;Mr. Van Dusen&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène was greatly relieved. He was just a boy
like any other boy, after all, and not a youthful Cyclops
or a Rapunzle. She asked more questions&mdash;about
the district, about Miss Fisher, about himself&mdash;to
all of which he replied in sentences of gradually increasing
length. So that when at the end of the two
miles&#8217; drive which took the ungainly horse half an hour
to cover, they drew up before a newly painted house
with a row of fine old maples shading it, she and
the youthful &#8220;whip,&#8221; had become fast friends.</p>

<p>Margaret had spied the family vehicle in the distance
and was at the gate to meet Helène. Affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
greetings exchanged, Helène was shown to her
room and ordered to remove the stains of travel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just too happy for words to have you here,&#8221;
exclaimed Margaret.</p>

<p>Helène looked at her friend and was delighted to see
that she had improved greatly. Her cheeks showed
the return of color, the scar on the temple had lost its
dull purple, and the expression on her face was just
the same Margy&#8217;s of old.</p>

<p>As they were descending the stairs, Margaret whispered:
&#8220;They are dying to see you; but they wouldn&#8217;t
for the world let you see their curiosity. We must
go to them in the kitchen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Post, I&#8217;ve brought my friend, Miss Barton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Post, a painfully plain and stolidly built woman
of middle age, was busily engaged at the range,
cooking. She turned a kindly face on hearing Margaret&#8217;s
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleased to meet ye, Miss Barton.&#8221; She wiped her
hands deliberately on a clean apron and let them drop
resignedly. Then, seeing the hand of Helène stretched
towards her, she seized it with a glad smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;So ye be Miss Fisher&#8217;s friend, be ye? Maybe
ye&#8217;re tired after yer long trip, hain&#8217;t ye, miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Mrs. Post, the journey was delightful
and new; especially the drive to the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, I guess it be. I ain&#8217;t had a ride ter the city
for nigh on five years. I mean Paterson. I&#8217;ve never
been to Noo York all my life. But ain&#8217;t ye hungry?
Dinner&#8217;ll be most ready in an hour&mdash;can ye wait that
long, miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène could and gladly would.</p>

<p>The two friends retired to rest in the shade of the
roomy porch, and to exchange confidences. There
were not many but, such as they were, they were interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
to them since they were born of their own
lives.</p>

<p>Margaret betrayed an anxiety lest others who were
more wealthy and could offer more pleasure and
comforts, might entice Helène away from her. Her
questions were carefully framed, however, and
Helène replied frankly and freely. She had not seen
Mr. Van Dusen more than she could help. She had
really thought little or nothing about him. Her
mind had been too much occupied with her work and
with thinking of Margaret.</p>

<p>Margaret, however, was not quite satisfied and persisted
in putting more questions all bearing on the
same subject, until Helène was quite puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you are driving at, Margy? Tell me,
now&mdash;what&#8217;s in your head?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret looked into the honest eyes of her friend,
clear as a June sky, and was satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess, nothing, my dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;nothing at
all. I love you so that I suspect everybody has designs
on your affections. I guess I&#8217;m just a jealous,
selfish old thing. Forget all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the mid-day meal Margaret, in obedience to
the doctor&#8217;s orders, retired to her room for a rest.
Helène, left to herself, took a book and recalling a
shady nook she had passed on her way to the farm-house,
crossed the road and sought its seclusion.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE small, moss-covered clearing under the
beeches proved to be an ideal retreat&mdash;a place
good for the soul longing for isolation&mdash;a
refuge for those desiring to escape from the insistent
call of the obstinate present.</p>

<p>The sloping ground, soft and furry like a carpet,
invited relaxation. The book seemed clever and promising&mdash;but
somehow she could not concentrate her attention
on its pages; her mind would wander off aimlessly.
She began to muse, and the volume slid on to
the moss.</p>

<p>This life she was living&mdash;was it really to be her life
always? This wonderful land had opened up to her
new vistas and new experiences. The people were, oh,
so kind and good to her. It was all very interesting
and no doubt worthy the efforts. But was this the land
for her&mdash;for her, the last of her race?</p>

<p>She had been so enthusiastic in the morning. She
had been looking forward to this little vacation for
many days; and now, when it had come, when everything
was just as she had wished it to be, she was not
happy!</p>

<p>What had become of her dreams of intimate exchange
of noble thoughts with dear friends? Where
were her romantic fancies of a world of love, of glory
and poetry? She knew not what these dreams and
fancies might actually be, but she was sure they were
not being realized now. Was her life&#8217;s horizon to be
landlocked as was this rural home? Was her life&#8217;s
goal to reach no farther than the making of pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
bonnets for strangers? Was this to be her ideal? Certainly
she had found a freedom from one kind of bondage,
but had she not obtained it only to find herself
bound by far more cruel fetters&mdash;the drudgery of a
life occupied in gaining a livelihood and losing its soul?</p>

<p>Would she be compelled to point to this as her only
achievement? And what would Mr. Morton say when
her hour of reckoning came with him? &#8220;And it was
for this&mdash;that you disobeyed your father&#8217;s wishes, and
gave me unspeakable pain!&#8221; Had she pained him?
Had she disregarded her father&#8217;s injunctions? Oh&mdash;if
she could but be enlightened on these doubts, these
ever recurring questions!</p>

<p>She sat meditating, lost to her surroundings while
the busy bees hummed and the flies buzzed about her.
A slender catbird, smooth and droll like a dainty squirrel,
its bright beetle eyes turned inquisitively upon the
intruder, slipped in and out of the underbrush&mdash;&#8220;Peep&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Peep&#8221;&mdash;its
mate joined in the sport,&mdash;&#8220;Peep,&#8221; and
they were gone. Little kinglets with their wine-colored
caps flitted from branch to branch, chirruping in sweet
confidence. A subdued whirr drew Helène&#8217;s eyes idly
to a tall plant swaying in blossom in the glaring sunshine;
above it was the most exquisite of little
creatures floating in a haze produced by the rapid motion
of its delicate wings, its thread-like bill seemingly
resting within the flower. Whirr&mdash;it had vanished!</p>

<p>Was this an enchanted glade or a fairy&#8217;s retreat?</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;even if she had done wrong in running away,
she had learned to know something of life, life as it was
to the vast majority of humankind. She had come to
know this great Western world&mdash;his own land.
Surely he could not but approve&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>An aggressive noise, resembling the sound of scissors
being ground on a whetstone, piercing and disturbing,
broke her reveries. Helène sat up staring into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the leafy tangle which screened her refuge. What
could it be? There it was again. It was only a locust,
had Helène but known it, but its arrival had broken
the spell; her retreat became once more but the hot,
sweltering clearing; the buzzing of the flies became
an annoyance, the bees a threat. She was again alone&mdash;a
stranger among a strange people.</p>

<p>Oh, no&mdash;not alone! There was always her good
Margy. No one could take her from her. And there
were her own thoughts and memories. No one could
steal them from her. And&mdash;autumn would soon be
here&mdash;the day of reckoning and, perhaps, the day of
promise, also&mdash;the day when her letter must be written
and sent. But her first duty was to Margaret. She
must help her dear friend and protector to get well. As
soon as they were again settled at home, she surely
would set to work on the letter. And an inward voice
whispered to her: &#8220;my knight without blemish.&#8221; She
rose and smoothed out her crumpled dress to cover
her self-confusion at the unspoken words.</p>

<p>Carefully picking her way through the tall weeds
and brush she gained the road. Glancing for a moment
towards the house she saw no one about; but the
next instant her attention was drawn to a distant cloud
of dust and the sound of the regular hoof-beats of
horses. A carriage was approaching, and soon it drew
up before the gate of the Post&#8217;s farm-house. Hesitating
what she should do, she saw a man alight, but,
instead of going up to the house, he turned and made
straight to where she was standing.</p>

<p>As he approached nearer she recognized Mr. Van
Dusen. Her indecision died in its inception. Hat in
one hand and the other extended cordially he called
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Miss Barton? I am so glad to see
you. What good fairy brought you here?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>Somewhat embarrassed, she permitted him to take
her hand, and press it lightly. He felt rather than
saw her indifference. &#8220;You are not pleased to see me,
Miss Barton?&#8221; he added with a weak smile. &#8220;But
never mind, since I am here, may I walk with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-s, Mr. Van Dusen. Miss Fisher is resting&mdash;the
doctor&#8217;s orders, you know&mdash;but it is almost time
for her to waken. Do you wish to see her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Miss Barton, I am not going to let you get rid
of me in that way. Let Miss Fisher have her full allowance
of sleep; my message to her can wait. Mother
sent me to invite her and you for a drive around the
lakes to-morrow. The country is looking so beautiful,
she thought you would enjoy the water and the hotels
along the shore. But may I be frank? I agreed to
be her messenger because I had heard you were expected
to-day. Now, please, Miss Barton, don&#8217;t look
so forbidding. I do so want to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène made a motion as if about to step back, a
slight blush suffusing her cheek and neck. Courteously
bowing her proud little head she said in somewhat staccato
tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Mr. Van Dusen; but I really think we
ought both of us go in to Miss Fisher. I am her guest,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Miss Barton, but let me have my way, won&#8217;t
you? This place, these woods, fields and lakes,&#8221; he
added with a wave of his arm, &#8220;have been my playground
ever since I was a boy. I know every nook
and corner. You are not alone Miss Fisher&#8217;s guest
but the guest of us all who live here and love this secluded
corner of Jersey. Do let me be your guide and
show you around.&#8221; His humorous eyes gave his face
so whimsical an expression that Helène almost regretted
her coldness towards him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen the orchard and the enchanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
bower of Kittanah, the Indian Maiden who dwelt here
more than two hundred years ago? No? It&#8217;s right
round the bend of this road, less than a minute&#8217;s walk,
and really well worth a visit. Shall we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>His playful insistence and her own desire to efface
the impression of her cool reception of him conquered
her indecision. She turned with him along the road
to where the orchard was situated.</p>

<p>Gnarled old fruit trees laden with red, green and
speckled apples, deep grass that clung to ankles, weeds
of unusual size and luxuriance, and all against a dense
clump of birches as background.</p>

<p>Within these birches were flat boulders covered with
lichen and small tufts of living green&mdash;&#8220;The Indian
bower, Miss Barton; behold the throne of Kittanah!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a pretty spot, and Helène felt no regret that
she had come. Van Dusen drew out his handkerchief,
spread it carefully over the rock and invited his companion
to sit down. &#8220;You must let me see how a white
maiden would appear upon the throne of her ancient
copper-colored sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène smilingly obeyed, and the young man stepped
back in mock criticism, nodding approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barton, tradition tells that this Indian maiden
outrivalled in beauty all the other girls of her age and
place. But I think&mdash;there never sat upon this rock
a more beautiful girl than she who is sitting there
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène rose. The very thing she had dreaded was
going to happen. She had been very foolish to come
to this place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barton, please sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what she was doing, Helène resumed
her seat, helplessly.</p>

<p>Van Dusen came close up to her, the smile gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
from his face, and in its place an expression of grim
determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barton, ever since I first met you I have had
but one thought&mdash;to win you if I could. I know you
have given me no encouragement; indeed, I believe you
have avoided me. Yet, I still beg of you to permit me
to plead my cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène, with downcast eyes, sat patiently, her hands
folded, a troubled expression on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t amount to much, I know, but I am a pretty
clean fellow and I am awfully fond of you. Won&#8217;t
you give me a chance to show you how in earnest I
am? To see more of you? There isn&#8217;t another girl
like you in this world. I know there are lots of fellows
much better than I, but&mdash;do give me a chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke the last words he took Helène&#8217;s hand,
his eager face flushed with his emotions. She gently
drew it away, and looking up piteously at the young
man she mustered just enough strength to say sadly:
&#8220;Mr. Van Dusen&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what to say, and if I
did I wouldn&#8217;t know how to say it. You are very kind.
I&mdash;I have never thought of any man as you wish me
to think of you. We ought not to have come here;
we should both of us then have been saved this great
embarrassment. Please, remember, that I have no one
but Miss Fisher&mdash;that I am her only friend. Shall we
return to the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barton, Helen dear, will you not give me some
encouragement, some hope&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Van Dusen&mdash;what can I say? Really, I
must not listen to you any longer. Pray, permit
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her heart in a riotous beating, her temples throbbing
and her face filled with indignation, Helène rose
and ran toward the orchard. And as she ran she kept
thinking: he had no right to speak to her thus: Margy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
would have to tell him that he must not visit them
again. Her feet became entangled in the deep grass
and treacherous brambles, and she was compelled to
walk and pick her way.</p>

<p>Van Dusen, who had followed her at a quick pace,
hurt and offended at he knew not what, was the first
to break the awkward silence following on the precipitate
flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry with me, Miss Barton. I did not
mean to hurt your feelings. I can see I am distasteful
to you; but you need have no fear.&#8221; He paused for
breath. Then seeing that she was finding it difficult
to get over the brambles, he added in an unconscious
<i>non sequitur</i>: &#8220;Pardon me, if you don&#8217;t keep to the
path you will tear your shoes and skirt. You are getting
into a patch of low bush blackberries; they are
worse than barbed wire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène stopped short, her sense of humor overcoming her.
After all the young man had not done anything
very grievous! Of course, it was absurd, but
he meant well and she had been wrong to be indignant
with him.</p>

<p>She turned to Van Dusen, and the smile which
met him was like a ray of sunshine breaking through
threatening clouds. &#8220;Mr. Van Dusen&mdash;I am sorry. It
was rude of me to run away. I was taken unawares.
Please pardon me. You may show me the path. I
can&#8217;t afford to ruin my shoes and spoil my vacation.
But you must promise me not to refer to the subject
again. Will you promise, Mr. Van Dusen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barton, I may not be a genius but nobody can
say I don&#8217;t know when I am not wanted. I apologize,&#8221;
he added in a more earnest and subdued voice, &#8220;and let
us be friends. I guess I am not good enough for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Van Dusen, you are unjust to yourself.
You are a gentleman and you have been very kind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
me. But&mdash;oh, well, I suppose I am foolish. Let us
go back to Miss Fisher.&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Dusen, silent and depressed, led the way back
along the path over the hard-baked field, through the
orchard and into the road. Helène spoke not another
word all the way.</p>

<p>Whether she intended it or not her silence convinced
Van Dusen that he need look for no further hope from
her. It was not coquetry, but a definite and permanent
refusal. What an ass he had been not to see that she
never cared for him! But that he, a Van Dusen,
should have been turned down by a snip of a milliner!
No, no, he must not think that. He was a cad to call
her names even in thought. Ah, she was a beautiful
girl&mdash;as good as they made them&mdash;but, she had not
been made for him, worse luck! Of course, there must
be another fellow. But, by George, couldn&#8217;t she look
proud! And what a temper she could show! Ah, but
she looked more beautiful angry than smiling. Oh,
well, if she didn&#8217;t care to talk he wouldn&#8217;t make her.
There was the gate, and there was Miss Fisher, all
in white, smiling and wholesome. After all, there was
no girl like an American girl. These foreigners&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, people, where have you two been?&#8221; came
Margaret&#8217;s cheery greeting to the silent pair emerging
from the cover of the trees; &#8220;exploring the landscape,
Helen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Miss Fisher!&#8221; Van Dusen welcomed
the break in the oppressive silence he had endured.
&#8220;You look very well. I need not ask if the
country is doing you good! Mother sent me with a
message to you, but as I learned you were resting I
proposed to Miss Barton to visit the &#8216;Kittanah Rock&#8217;&mdash;and
here we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Mr. Van Dusen. Come in and sit
down in the shade. This is the only cool spot I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
around here. Were you interested in the Indian Rock,
Helen? You didn&#8217;t know we could boast of ancient
history here, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat on the camp chairs in the grass under the
spreading maples, chatting in desultory fashion. Helène,
however, soon retired to her room, offering as an
excuse her dishevelled condition after the walk.</p>

<p>As he sat facing the comely Margaret with her
shrewd eyes, Van Dusen realized that it would be useless
for him to make a secret of what had happened
in the orchard. He saw that she already more than
guessed. Moreover, his disappointment at the rebuff
made him feel a deep desire to unburden himself; perhaps,
also, to obtain a little sympathy. He sought for
an opportunity, and it came when Helène left them
together. But it was Margaret who seized it first.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been saying to Helen, Mr. Van
Dusen? She seems unusually quiet, and she kept her
eyes away from you. I have elected myself Helen&#8217;s
guardian, you know, and her happiness is dear to me.
What&#8217;s been the trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Fisher,&#8221; the young man fidgeted and spoke
nervously. &#8220;I know you will be angry with me. I&#8217;ve
made an arrant fool of myself. I proposed to Miss
Barton, and was promptly refused. I hardly know
how I came to do it, but, I suppose I couldn&#8217;t help
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s face paled; she closed her eyes and said
not a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Fisher, I see you are angry. But I&#8217;ve made
it all right. I don&#8217;t know how I came to forget myself,
because, as I sit here now, I feel as if I&#8217;m not in love
with her at all&mdash;and never have been. If I feel hurt
it&#8217;s not my heart that has been wounded, but my vanity.
Do say a kind word to me, Miss Fisher. I don&#8217;t
want you to send me away in anger.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>Margaret opened her eyes and looked at Van Dusen
for a moment with slight disdain. The ingenuousness
of the young man, however, was so transparent, and
indicated so honest a nature that she was moved to
smile&mdash;the free and open smile which only she could
give.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor boy!&#8221; she said, &#8220;I guess you are right, you
couldn&#8217;t help it. I don&#8217;t blame you. If I were a man
I would have done as you did. But you must not come
with us to-morrow; it would be awkward for both
of you. Oh, I do wish men wouldn&#8217;t insist on making
love to every pretty girl they meet; I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve
now spoiled Helen&#8217;s vacation&mdash;the first one the child
has had. I don&#8217;t know if you understand what that
means to a working-girl, because you&#8217;ve never done
a day&#8217;s work in your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, missie, I don&#8217;t. But what can I
do? Father thinks I am a dunce; the fellows I know
don&#8217;t do anything great, and mother wants me to do
the social stunt and shine. I wish I could do something.
Won&#8217;t you advise me, Miss Fisher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Advise you? Why, Mr. Van Dusen, I don&#8217;t see
that it is any of my business! And please don&#8217;t
&#8216;Missie&#8217; me. I am too old for that. Really, you make
me laugh. I honestly believe you haven&#8217;t grown up
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any other young man might have resented the snubbing
he was getting, but Van Dusen enjoyed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Miss Fisher,&#8221; he said laughingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not nearly the boy you think I am. And if you
keep on looking at me with those nice eyes of yours&mdash;I&#8217;ll
make another fool of myself. Now, please don&#8217;t
get angry. I&#8217;m going to behave from now on. You
are right about the drive to-morrow, though I&#8217;m
awfully sorry to miss the pleasure of showing you
round. I had been looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>His tone was light, but it was evident that he was
feeling the deprivation deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think little of me, Miss Fisher. I hope
some day to prove to you that I can be of some use
in the world. Say good-bye to Miss Barton for me,
please. Good-bye, Miss Fisher, and think kindly of
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Dusen rose and held out his hand to Margaret,
who had reddened in spite of herself. Really, he
looked a manly fellow in his earnestness, despite the
flippancy of his manner. She couldn&#8217;t help appreciating
the sterling nature which it hid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she said quietly as she took his hand in
her friendly clasp.</p>

<p>She watched him get into the carriage and take the
reins from the waiting groom, and noticed how well
he sat his seat. Van Dusen turned and raised his hat
in a parting farewell to her smiling nods. There was
not a trace to be seen of either disappointment or
chagrin in his laughing eyes, as he drove up the road
and was lost in the wooded avenue. Margaret turned
and walked pensively into the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Labor Day had become a memory; Margaret was
now fully recovered, and both girls were back at their
duties. Their well-regulated life, which had been so
rudely interrupted by the accident, resumed its even
course. The new actors which, in consequence of that
distressing event, had come into it, in no way disturbed
the even tenor of their ways.</p>

<p>Helène met the spurned wooer, after not a few
qualms of conscience, with quiet friendliness. Van
Dusen, on his part, had swallowed his disappointment
and became a devoted friend, using the privileges of
an elder brother, which had been extended to him.
Helène had but hinted to Margaret at what had occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
between her and Van Dusen, and Margaret had
refrained from inquiring too curiously. It was best
to leave well alone, she thought.</p>

<p>Flowers still came to the house in Gramercy Park;
but their destination was the reverse of what it had
been before. Then it had been Helène who was the
recipient of the roses and giant asters and Margaret
of the lesser flowers. Now it was to Margaret that
the more gorgeous plants were addressed, and to Helène
were relegated modest little bouquets of lilies and
pansies (pansies? Did he mean&mdash;heartsease?) and
cornflowers.</p>

<p>The arrival of the flowers for Margaret usually
presaged an evening&#8217;s outing, and Helène soon came
to understand that the bouquets which came for her
were but the expressions of courtesy and brotherly attention.
She did not fail to tease Van Dusen on the
change, in her more audacious moods, to his smiling
content.</p>

<p>With renewed health Margaret&#8217;s cheeks filled out
and regained their old roundness and color. Indeed,
her illness had improved her appearance. She began
to add to nature&#8217;s gifts the productions of the lore of
the &#8220;Modiste&#8221; and blossomed into as charming a woman
as ever attracted the eyes of the dwellers of the Park.</p>

<p>And now, with the waning of the summer, the first
signs of the new &#8220;season&#8221; began to appear on the
Avenue. The World of Fashion was returning to its
urban fields of activity; the shops once more became
busy hives of jostling women. The evenings scintillated
and sparkled with brilliant lights and more brilliant
costumes. The glamor of the city drew people
from the country, and once again the busy stir of business
and pleasure filled the blue-covered cañons of
New York.</p>

<p>As for Margaret and Helène, work kept them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
ennui. It was a lesson to Helène, and she entered on
the work of the season with all her heart.</p>

<p>The letter, the task of writing the important letter,
had occupied her thoughts for many months, sometimes
as ominous, often as a ray of hope, occasionally
as a burden, but always as a sacred duty&mdash;a pilgrimage
to a shrine. She had begun its composition and had
destroyed what she had written time and again. And
every time she had put off its completion, waiting for
a happier mood. When did autumn begin? Mrs.
Kane&#8217;s almanac said the twenty-second of September.
And that was but a few days off. Well, she would
obey the promptings of her heart and do it now. It
was an evening when Margaret had decided to take
an inventory of their belongings to see what they required
in the way of dresses for the coming season,
and she had retired early, leaving Helène to herself.
She sat down determined to get it done with once for
all. At the end of an hour the letter was finished, all
but the date and signature. She read it over carefully,
and although she was not satisfied she decided it would
have to do.</p>

<p>Surely he would understand! She wondered what
he was doing in Cleveland, and if he ever thought of
his friend of the Carpathians. Perhaps he had found
some rich and beautiful girl of his own country!</p>

<p>And his mother and sister? Was the Ruth he had
spoken of like the girls who came to Madame Lucile&#8217;s&mdash;free
and lively and gay and often slangy? Was his
mother like Mrs. Van Dusen, with her haughty air and
jewelled fingers?</p>

<p>These and the like questions she put to herself only
to add to her hesitancy of purpose and distress of
heart. She had learned much but she was still a child
and knew very little of life, especially of life in
America.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>The greatest of all teachers, the omnipotent opener
of all eyes and all minds, had not yet come to her. Love
may be blind, but it is a wonderful magician for opening
the heart&#8217;s far-seeing eyes. It may be blind to the
object of its passion, but as a teacher it takes the highest
rank. Helène did not know this. She was alone in
the world&mdash;without a home, without a father or
mother, without even her birthright. In this land of
her adoption she was still a stranger. She could but
follow the impulses of her heart blindly. She did not
realize it, but it was love that led her. And Monday
would be the twenty-second!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">VERY soon after he had entered on his administrative
duties in connection with the business
his father had bequeathed him, John Morton
had found that one thing was certain&mdash;he must give
his whole heart and mind to the work, or things would
go wrong. Judge Lowell had put it to him characteristically
when he said: &#8220;You must either attend strictly
to the executive work, or pay some one else to do it
for you. A leader cannot sit astraddle.&#8221; Morton had
not believed him, at first, but it was not long before
he found, to his sorrow, that the judge was right; and
then he knuckled down to the system.</p>

<p>When he began gradually to master the fundamental
principles of generalship underlying the direction of
so gigantic an enterprise, he experienced a curious
sense of elation and self-satisfaction. Nothing pleased
him more than to notice the admiration in the eyes
of the old warhorses of his father&#8217;s army. The knottiest
of problems, he found, would yield to earnest
thought and tactful work.</p>

<p>Those who, at the beginning, had looked at him
evasively or contemptuously, had of late given both
their approval and confidence. The heads of the many
diversified interests had tested him and had found he
was not wanting. They realized that he was both able
and strong. &#8220;A chip of the old block,&#8221; some of them
said with a smile, and others would remark: &#8220;I told
you the acorn wouldn&#8217;t drop very far from the oak,&#8221;
or &#8220;Old Dan in his prime wasn&#8217;t in it with the boy.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
These were the opinions expressed by those who were
in the business with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Street&#8221; had even begun to whisper that it
wasn&#8217;t wise to monkey with young Morton, and grizzled
old bankers had found it desirable to consult with
him before deciding on some of their &#8220;big moves.&#8221;
From the outset he had declined offices on financial
boards, pleading lack of experience; but somehow important
enterprises would be mentioned to him at their
inception. The players on the chess-board knew that it
was safer to give Morton a chance to make a move or
not, as he felt inclined. Thus it was that every day
found Morton more firmly seated in his father&#8217;s ample
chair, and found also that the work connected with his
duties left him more and more invigorated.</p>

<p>His life with such responsibilities was bound to become
circumscribed in ever-narrowing circles, and
could not fail to leave on him, both in his features and
bearing, indelible marks of care and thought. He
found little room for indecision, small opportunity for
moroseness, and fewer moments for idle dreaming.
He carried himself so seriously that his old friends at
the club scarcely recognized in him the John Morton
of the past. He no longer found time for intercourse
with men of science, nor for indulgence in reading
books. John Morton had, indeed, come into Adam&#8217;s
legacy&mdash;work and plenty of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton and Ruth, although they could have
but few opportunities for coming in contact with the
business world, heard some of these good opinions.
Married ladies, from whom their husbands kept no
business secrets, would repeat what they had been told;
fiancées would carry the expressions their future lords
and master had made about Morton; Judge Lowell, on
his occasional visits, never failed to avow his high esteem
of this paragon of a son. They heard that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
been elected to the dignified offices his father had held,
and to which only honorable and estimable men were
called; that his advice and counsel were sought in
matters of public welfare, civic improvement and works
of charity. The Randolph in him may have been
strong, but there was enough Morton in his composition
to make his power felt, and those who looked to
him for action were not disappointed.</p>

<p>Mother and admiring sister regretted his now regular
absence from their drawing-room gatherings and
his even less frequent visits to the country home. But
the women of America are content to accept the demands
that business makes on their husbands and
brothers. As long as John kept his health and looked
as handsome as ever, with his face lit up by his humorous
smile, they were satisfied.</p>

<p>They had almost forgotten the existence of &#8220;the
dark lady&#8221; of the Carpathians. Ruth had gone so far
as to say that she believed John &#8220;had been stringing&#8221;
them about her. She still was as determined as ever
to marry her handsome brother to some beautiful
American girl, which was her reason for not sharing
in her mother&#8217;s pride at his continued devotion to business.
Not that she objected to hear people talk in
praise of John; but she could see no sense in working
so hard for money when they already had more than
they needed. John lived like a hermit, she said.</p>

<p>Her brother would listen to her smilingly, pat her
on the cheek and explain that the interests of their estate
demanded it. Her mother would talk of the
sacred duty John owed to his father&#8217;s plans. But
neither argument had much weight with Ruth, for
whom life was a much more interesting affair than
mere money-making. However, she said nothing, but
quietly made up her mind to carry out her plans. She&#8217;d
see that John married, come what may.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>Moved by the desire to be nearer her son, Mrs. Morton,
towards the middle of the summer, had brought
her household goods from Newport to the big mansion
on the Hudson. John had agreed to come there at least
once during the week and to spend his Sundays with
her. She made occasional trips to New York for
shopping and visiting purposes, on which Ruth would
often accompany her&mdash;especially for the shopping. On
such occasions they generally succeeded in bringing
John home with them. They found that he was willing
to break important engagements, though to them
these engagements seemed strangely unimportant. He
would meet them at some store or at the Terminal,
and his escort was always an added pleasure to them.
Mrs. Morton, in particular, felt a great pride in driving
home with her son. Their arrival was like a triumphal
entry into some feudal castle. Her eyes would
beam with delight as she noted the servants&#8217; admiring
glances at &#8220;Mr. John,&#8221; or the proprietary pride of the
old station-master&#8217;s greeting of &#8220;Mr. Morton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes Ruth would go alone to visit a school
friend, who would assist her in selecting her purchases.
It was on one of these private expeditions that she
&#8217;phoned John and, catching him in a moment of weakness,
wheedled him into a promise to meet her at Maillard&#8217;s
that day at five, and to take her back to Tarrytown.</p>

<p>Punctual, as always, John was at the confectioner&#8217;s&mdash;the
favorite place of those ladies who believe they
need reviving refreshment of a stronger nature than
can be obtained at the ordinary department stores.
His arrival made Ruth and Hattie Brown, her friend,
the envy of the other girls, who saw this distinguished-looking
man greeting them. Is it unkind to suggest that
Ruth had selected the place of rendezvous with this
effect in view?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>John had met Miss Brown on many previous occasions,
so that he looked at the girls&#8217; effusive leave-taking
without much emotion. Ruth&#8217;s great charm to
him had always been her perfect naturalness of manner,
but this did not prevent her behaving as other girls
did when she was with them. Once alone in the carriage
with him, however, she quickly resumed her
vivacious self and was her brother&#8217;s comrade again.</p>

<p>The girl was excited, full of fun and bubbling over
with laughter, much to her brother&#8217;s amusement.
Something unusual must have happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that piece of fine old timber on our
grounds, John? I mean on the slope to the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>John nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve taken a fancy to it and want it all for
myself. It&#8217;s been neglected, because it hasn&#8217;t got what
people call &#8216;a wonderful view.&#8217; It needs draining and
some paths cutting through it. Won&#8217;t you spare an
hour and come with me to look it over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; her brother remarked carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will please me, won&#8217;t you, John, dear, and
have the woods put into good condition? I&#8217;m tired
of hearing about grand vistas and glorious sights and
distant purple hills and all that kind of rot. It&#8217;s a
perfectly lovely bit of timber, and if you go the right
way about it, it can be made into a most delightful spot
and a real refuge for birds and small game. Put some
quail on the place and mummy and I will see that they
are taken care of and fed in the winter. Now is just
the time, before it gets too cold. If you do this for
me, John, I&#8217;ll reciprocate. Oh, I&#8217;ve made the most
marvellous discovery to-day. I&#8217;ll let you in on it, if
you&#8217;ll be good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth rattled away without pausing for breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sis, I&#8217;ll go round the place with you and try
to see it with your enthusiastic eyes; but the superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
is really the right man. However, your wish
shall be a command. Now, what&#8217;s this wonderful reward
I&#8217;m to get for being good?&#8221; He spoke in a bantering
voice, smiling at the excited face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you in good time. It&#8217;ll do you good to feed
on your curiosity a little. You haven&#8217;t enough emotion
in you, anyway, John. All you do is work and plan.
Before you know it, you&#8217;ll be nothing but a thinking
machine. Ah, but I&#8217;ve got a charm up my sleeve that&#8217;ll
make you come out of your shell and be your old self
again. Oh, John, if you only knew!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this mysterious thing you are hiding? A
new collie, or a plant that sings between drinks, or
some new genius? Tell, oh, sloe-eyed daughter of my
race!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can laugh at me, if you like; but I tell you,
John, I&#8217;ve struck it rich. You&#8217;ll have to wait. All
things come to him who waits. First my woods and
roads and drains, and then&mdash;your reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had arrived at the Terminal by this time and
John had all he could do to guide Ruth through the
crowd into the train. In due course they reached home
and a short time after the modest family of three were
seated round the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Though a simple function, dinner was always an
important affair for Mrs. Morton when her son was
with them. She took pride in seating him in the high-backed
chair at the head of the table and would gaze
lovingly at his handsome face and listen entranced to
his conversation. In Mrs. Morton&#8217;s opinion John could
talk better than Daniel Webster. A day&#8217;s absence
would afford her an excuse for discovering new virtues
in her boy. Unlike the other women of her station,
she had remained what they would have characterized
as &#8220;old-fashioned.&#8221; Home to her had its old
meanings and old duties&mdash;it meant home, and not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
mere stopping-place for the country club or the golf
links or the porch for slangy gossip. So that visitors
to her house still found in it the air of bygone days
and were grateful for it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton had long since laid out her course of
life and kept to it. She knew that so long as John
felt that he was taking care of her and Ruth, he would
stick to his business. She herself was not at all necessary
to him; but her pride lay in his strength and ability
to succeed. She was deeply afraid he might drift
again into the &#8220;bohemian life&#8221; of aimless study and
travel, as she classed his previous lapses into those
fields. She could understand being a gentleman of
leisure, even approve of it; she could easily accept the
life of ceaseless labor and planning of business enterprises,
for she had had the example of that in her boy&#8217;s
father; but she could see nothing in studying for
study&#8217;s sake, or in a devotion to research for the object
of discovery. This might do for eccentric foreigners
or crazy college professors; but for a Morton
or a Randolph?&mdash;Never!</p>

<p>But Ruth had no such compunctions of mind, no such
scruples of conscience or carefully set plans. As they
sat over the meal and she listened to the serious discussion
between her mother and John on subjects in which
she had not the slightest interest, she became impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, dear,&#8221; she said, breaking in. &#8220;I must tell
you what happened to me this afternoon. Please stop
talking shop and bothering about those horrid men in
their offices, without souls, who sit there like spiders
in webs. Anyone listening to you two would think you
were a couple of promoters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, Ruth, you might have chosen a better comparison,&#8221;
remarked Mrs. Morton severely. &#8220;What is
this wonderful thing that happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth, not a bit abashed at the reproof, went on:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>&#8220;Well, Hattie and I were snoopin&#8217; around looking
for things, you know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I wish you&#8217;d be a little more select in your
vocabulary,&#8221; remonstrated her mother mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mummy, dear, you must let me tell my story my
own way. As I was saying, Hattie and I were shopping.
You know Hattie simply won&#8217;t have anything
else but the latest and Frenchiest, and no trouble&#8217;s too
much for her so long as she digs it out. We had been
to all the likeliest places&mdash;to Arnitt&#8217;s and Longman&#8217;s
and Carson&#8217;s and many others, when she insisted that
we should go to Madame Lucile&#8217;s. The great lady
herself waited on her, and Hattie tried on almost everything
there was in the place&mdash;hats, bonnets, laces,
plumes, frocks&mdash;and could not be suited. While the
things were on the shelves they looked beautiful, but
when Hattie tried them on she couldn&#8217;t bear them. I
am sure Madame must have been disgusted. Even I
was getting ashamed of her. Well, at last Madame
suggested that Mademoiselle Hello-a, or a name something
like that, should come and give her opinion. The
young lady, she said, was the very latest arrival from
abroad and was absolutely faultless in her taste. Well,
Mademoiselle with the profane name was sent for and
well, she is simply wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth gazed at her listeners with eyes that said what
no words could express. They seemed to suggest
dreams of delight and beauty. John leaned back and
roared with laughter. Ruth gave him a mingled look
of pity and disdain, and turned to her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma, you never in your life saw such a beautiful
girl. Honest, she&#8217;s simply a wonder. It&#8217;s all very
well for you to laugh, John, but you&#8217;ve not seen her.
But I&#8217;ll take you to see her and then you&#8217;ll know if I&#8217;m
right or not. I don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s a day older than
I am, but, somehow she&#8217;s quite womanly. And her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
face, oh, mother, it&#8217;s like the face of that beautiful
Gainsborough picture we have, only much younger.
Her hair is the loveliest color and her eyes are like
violets. As for her figure&mdash;well&mdash;I&#8217;d give my eye-teeth
to have one like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Ruth, let up a little, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; chuckled
John, &#8220;if you go on I&#8217;ll have to be carried out by the
butler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you, you&#8217;ll have to be carried out when
you see her; she&#8217;s a stunner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth, dear, don&#8217;t get so excited,&#8221; begged Mrs.
Morton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not excited, mother; but John doesn&#8217;t understand.
He&#8217;s never heard her speak, or he wouldn&#8217;t make
fun of what I&#8217;m saying. She talks the prettiest English
in the loveliest voice you ever heard&mdash;and she&#8217;s
so modest and refined. I tell you she&#8217;s one in a million.
I bet she&#8217;s a lady&mdash;every inch of her&mdash;and I
couldn&#8217;t help saying nice things to her. You ought
to have seen her blush when I said I&#8217;d like to know
her. If the girl ever does her blushing stunt when
you&#8217;re around, John, you&#8217;ll just walk right up and propose
to her on the spot. And I hope she&#8217;d accept you.
And now, here&#8217;s my proposition. If you fix up my
woods, I&#8217;ll introduce you to her. Mummy, dear, you
must come to New York with me and invite her out.
You&#8217;ll fall in love with her. You will come and ask
her, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Ruth, how can we invite a shop-girl to this
house? You are so impulsive, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not a shop-girl; she&#8217;s a lady,&#8221; exclaimed
Ruth, indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But a girl you know nothing about; how can you
think of it? I never heard such a thing! What did
Hattie Brown say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Hattie! She thought her very beautiful; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
she prefers dark people. Madame Lucile told us afterwards
that the young lady was highly educated. Now,
I&#8217;ve said all I have to say. If you don&#8217;t want to meet
her, John, that&#8217;s your loss. But I tell you she&#8217;s a
wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>John saw that his sister was really in earnest and
would hurt her feelings if he carried his jocular manner
too far. Rising, he went up to her and put his
arms around her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, sissie, some day I&#8217;ll ask you to introduce
me. But not just now. I&#8217;m going to Idaho. I&#8217;ll seek
your kind favors when I get back. Mother, dear,&#8221; he
turned to Mrs. Morton, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go to Jackson&#8217;s
Hole next week. Do you mind if I take the opportunity
to put in a week&#8217;s shooting? I feel I need the
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John,&#8221; exclaimed his mother, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad
you&#8217;re going to take a vacation. You deserve it, and
I&#8217;m sure you need it. When do you start? There&#8217;s
nothing to keep you so far as I am concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, mater, I&#8217;ll start next Tuesday. That
will give me two days here. Judge Lowell arrives on
Friday and promised to remain until I return. He&#8217;ll
see to everything you may want. When you feel like
going to town to stay for the season, I&#8217;ve leased
the Arkwright house, and I&#8217;ve taken the even
days for Box 17 at the Opera. Shall we have our
coffee on the verandah, mother; it&#8217;s a lovely evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton smiled her assent; but said nothing
further about his going away. Since her husband&#8217;s
death she had clung to John with a double tenacity&mdash;a
mother&#8217;s love for a son, and a woman&#8217;s reliance on
the man. But she was too wise to permit her own
feelings to come between them. When, later in the
evening, the three were together in the spacious living-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Ruth took her brother aside and finally got her
way about the little wood.</p>

<p>The following morning Morton returned to the city.
But this time he carried back with him his old dreams.
Ruth&#8217;s story at the dinner-table had unlocked a door
in his memory which he had kept closed; and now the
gracious spirit wandered once more about the chambers
of his mind giving him neither rest nor hope.</p>

<p>Would the promised letter arrive? Perhaps it was
even now on its way to him across the ocean! What
if it should come while he was away in Idaho? He
made a note to leave instructions that it must be forwarded
on to him.</p>

<p>Love is said to give the lover almost supernatural
powers of insight and vision, as if the mysterious force
produced a psychical state which responded in harmony
to the presence of the loved one. If this be true,
then Morton must have been born of a different species.
In all his concentrated thoughts of Helène he saw
her either in some retired village in Germany, or in
some nunnery, or sitting in tearful neglect in a dreary
attic, or living with some high-born relative and walking
the world a queen in grace and beauty, the cynosure
of all eyes. But never for one instant did he picture
her in New York, working patiently and hopefully
in a place he had passed a thousand times.</p>

<p>On the Saturday which was to be his last in town
for some weeks to come, Morton decided to lunch at
his club before leaving for Tarrytown. On the way
he stopped his brougham at a gunsmith&#8217;s to purchase
a rifle and ammunition for his hunting trip. Was it
fate or did a mischievous fairy plan it?</p>

<p>It was a lovely day, one of those days on which
in certain places of the earth, far from the madding
crowd, fairies would come out of their secret places
and dance in the green glades of the cool forest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
New York&#8217;s cañons of streets were blue and gold under
the gracious sunlit skies. Surely one of those lively
sprites must have mistaken the city in its shining
beauty for a new kind of forest; for of a certainty
he was there. He must have skipped in past the yawning
policeman at the corner, heedless of the noise and
the crowds, and careless of the consequences. Seeing
Morton in his carriage he must have whispered to
him to stop at the gunsmith&#8217;s shop and go inside and
take his time. And this same little fellow must have
arranged it that Michael Sweeney, the best judge in
the city of a damascened barrel, with the finest touch
for adjusting the trigger, should just then be in the
shop to wait on customers. For Michael, withal his
watery eyes, could weigh powder with the skill of an
assayer and discourse of guns as though they were
his beloved children. Morton forgot where he was
and who he was, so entranced was he. All he felt
was that he was going away for a vacation&mdash;he was
putting work away and going to play! The fairy had
certainly enchanted him.</p>

<p>Outside on the avenue the horses in the brougham
stamped in nervous impatience, switching their short
tails in vain efforts to keep the flies away; the old
coachman on the box had grown tired of flicking his
whip and had dozed off in the warm shade. And all
the time Morton was under Michael&#8217;s spell. Then
the fairy, who had timed it well, touched the weight
of the old clock in the corner and started so loud a
whirr that Mike was disconcerted. The asthmatic
gong gave a hoarse ding-dong&mdash;it was one o&#8217;clock!</p>

<p>Immediately Morton realized that he was to get the
2.30 train and that he had had no luncheon. He made
for the exit hurriedly, giving at the same time brusque
instructions to Michael to bring his purchases to the
carriage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>Michael had wrapped everything very carefully, as
was his custom, using the brown paper and string
which the famous establishment always took care
should be of the best, and hurried out in obedience to
Morton&#8217;s instructions. Now what followed proves
conclusively that there was a fairy or a leprechaun,
as Michael would have called him, in New York that
afternoon. For Michael had not taken two steps beyond
his door, when the string broke and the contents
of the brown paper parcel&mdash;hooks, lines and
sinkers&mdash;were scattered, like the buttermilk from the
pitcher of the fair Kitty of Coleraine, all over the
place. Sweeney, the impeccable, looked aghast and
could but stare at the articles rolling and sliding in
every direction.</p>

<p>Morton was on the point of stepping into his carriage,
but hearing the commotion he stopped and
turned round. And here is where the fine Italian hand
of the fairy came in. For now Morton also made a
discovery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS this Saturday was to be the last of the half-holidays
of the summer, Margaret and Helène
were devoting it to replenishing their wardrobes
for the coming autumn. Monday would be &#8220;Fall
Opening&#8221; day, with its resumption of longer working
hours, and no other opportunity would be given them
for this most necessary preparation for the winter.</p>

<p>The avenue was crowded. Idle promenaders
mingled with people hurrying to and from work, all
exhibiting, in dress and manner, the many phases of
life in the metropolis. A touch of crispness in the
air gave warning of the change in the season.</p>

<p>Margaret, broad and commanding, walked by the
side of Helène as though protecting the slender figure
in black from the press about them. Bent on their important
affairs they stepped briskly along regardless
of those about them and arrived at the gunsmith&#8217;s at
the very instant of Michael Sweeney&#8217;s mishap.</p>

<p>Michael, bent and perspiring with the effort of collecting
the scattered objects, straightened up to allow
the two ladies to pass. Morton, at that moment,
turned and saw one of them skip gracefully aside and
then catch up with her companion&#8217;s gait. In that same
instant Morton experienced a sudden singing in his
brain followed by an association of ideas and an awakening
of memory. He became dimly conscious of
something familiar about the graceful skip of the
young woman in black, and looked searchingly at the
face beneath the broad-brimmed hat and veil. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
once he made an undignified jump from the carriage
step and was walking rapidly after the two
girls.</p>

<p>He caught up with them and looked sharply as he
passed; the next instant he had stopped right in front
of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse Helène!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène shot a frightened look at the man before
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton!&#8221; The silvery voice bathed him in
beatific memories. He saw nothing but the girl; nay,
it may be doubted if he even saw her. He had taken
the little hand which had been involuntarily stretched
out to him and he now held it firmly as though fearful
it might slip away from him, his face mirrored with
his emotions. The rest of creation did not exist; it
contained but this girl and himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comtesse Helène&mdash;for once fortune has favored
me&mdash;I am so glad, so glad.&#8221; He could find no other
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Morton, I wrote you last night and mailed
the letter this morning. And that I should meet you
to-day of all days!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but I guess you&#8217;ve forgotten me,&#8221; interposed
Margaret in her driest of drawls. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
you introduce me, Helen?&#8221;</p>

<p>John&#8217;s face flushed and Helène looked prettily embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I beg your pardon, Margy,&#8221; and then turning
to John smilingly, she said slowly and distinctly:
&#8220;Miss Helen Barton has the honor to present to
Mr. Morton her dear friend and chum, Miss Margaret
Fisher.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret offered her hand with somewhat cold reserve.
This entrance of a male friend into her shy
ward&#8217;s acquaintance was both unexpected and inexplicable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Mr. Morton looked all right&mdash;too much so,
she thought with a tinge of resentment.</p>

<p>Morton, by this time, had regained his composure,
and shook Margaret&#8217;s hand heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that we have been properly made acquainted
with each other, may I inquire where you ladies are
bound for? It is a long time since I last saw Miss-er-Barton.
Have you had luncheon?&#8221;</p>

<p>No, they had not. And then, to Margaret&#8217;s astonishment,
the timid, ingenuous Helène immediately accepted
the offer which followed. On their way to the
hotel, Morton did his best to appear calm and divided
his attentions equally between the two girls. When
they were settled comfortably near a window looking
out on the avenue of one of New York&#8217;s famous hostelries,
Margaret could not help speculating as to who
this man was. He evidently possessed Ali Baba&#8217;s
countersign, for he was waited on most assiduously.
A seat at this particular hotel had always seemed to
her to be the reward of the world&#8217;s elect. She glanced
inquiringly at Helène, who was all unconscious of
what was passing through her friend&#8217;s mind, and to
Margaret&#8217;s increasing wonder Helène was taking the
whole affair as if a luncheon at the Waldorf were an
everyday occurrence. With the utmost sang-froid she
removed her gloves and, to Morton&#8217;s delight, the protecting
veil. Her eyes were sparkling with a light
Margaret had never before seen in them. Who and
what was this Mr. Morton? She was becoming really
jealous of this interloper. She remembered that Helen
had once casually referred to a Mr. Morton she
had known &#8220;in the old country.&#8221; But this man was
unquestionably an American! She watched him closely
and noted the animation in look and tone whenever
he spoke to Helen. Then she remembered that on
meeting her in the avenue he had addressed her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
&#8220;Countess.&#8221; What did he mean? Margaret was both
puzzled and hurt.</p>

<p>Morton felt a restraint in himself and rightly judged
that a similar feeling existed in the girls. He made
an effort to remove it. Turning to Margaret, he said:
&#8220;I cannot tell you, Miss Fisher, how glad I am to have
met Miss Barton. When we said good-bye to each
other last it was thousands of miles from here, and I
suppose we both find it difficult to realize that the world
is a very small place after all. You will, therefore,
pardon me, I hope, for seeming unattentive. But I
promise to behave better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margery at once saw the situation now. She
guessed they would have many things to say to each
other which her presence prevented them discussing.
&#8220;Two is company and three is a crowd,&#8221; she said to
herself.</p>

<p>Smiling amiably in response to Morton&#8217;s explanation,
she turned to Helène and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, dear, I&#8217;m sure you and Mr. Morton have
much to say to each other. Now, please, don&#8217;t mind
me. I am going to devote myself to the good things
I see before me, and then I can enjoy looking at the
styles of the women passing by the window. This is
a rare treat for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène said nothing, but a tell-tale blush spoke volumes.
Morton laughed and said that Miss Fisher was
right; he&#8217;d take full advantage of her forbearance.</p>

<p>Suiting his action to the word he drew his chair
more closely to Helène, and before many minutes had
passed the two had quite forgotten Margaret&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have kept my promise, Mr. Morton. I sent the
letter this morning and it would have reached you on
Monday&mdash;the first day of autumn. You will believe
that I have never forgotten your kindness to me, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Morton. It was, indeed, not ingratitude that kept me
silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am too happy to think of finding fault. Now
that we have met again, I shall say not a word of
censure. You are looking very well. Ah, Miss Barton,
I give you warning that you won&#8217;t lose me again.
To think that you should have been in New York for
these five long months when I have searched the continent
of Europe for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know now, Mr. Morton, that it was, perhaps,
wrong of me not to have communicated with you
earlier. But I am very happy now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you how glad I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been very content of late in my independence.
It makes me proud to be able to say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe it,&#8221; responded Morton thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;Mr. Morton&mdash;it is all owing to Margy. She
was and still is my good angel. I don&#8217;t know what I
should have done without her. She has been my comfort
and stay and the most patient and dearest friend
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène stretched her arm across the table and
pressed Margaret&#8217;s hand, the tears filling her eyes.
Margaret blushed and stroked Helène&#8217;s slender fingers.
Praise always called up her innate modesty of nature.
&#8220;You think too much of me, darling,&#8221; she whispered,
smiling happily.</p>

<p>Morton looked at Margaret keenly. This was an
unusual woman, he thought, as he noted the broad
forehead and firm yet kindly mouth. He would not
forget her kindness to the orphaned girl.</p>

<p>During the meal Margaret kept stealing glances at
Helène. She could scarcely explain the nature of the
change she now saw. This erstwhile quiet, simple
maiden might be a princess, so queenly did she bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
herself and so beautiful was she in her animation.
&#8220;What a difference a man makes!&#8221; she thought bitterly,
&#8220;especially if he is the right man,&#8221; she added as
an afterthought.</p>

<p>The luncheon over Morton remembered that he
ought to have been on his way to Tarrytown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you excuse me for a moment, ladies? My
mother expects me home, and I ought to send word
to her that I will be delayed. Have you any engagement
for this evening, Miss Barton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Morton,&#8221; Helène replied, &#8220;but I must not
keep you from your family and friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barton, I have been in great good luck to-day,
and I should like to take every advantage of it. Shall
we say dinner at seven and the theatre after? Help
me, Miss Fisher, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton was longing to be alone with Helène, and
as he did not quite understand the relationship which
existed between the two girls, he put the question
hoping that she would take the initiative. He was
determined not to part from Helène until he had had
an opportunity to hear her whole story from her own
lips.</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s practical nature saw more than the surface
of things showed, and she had seen sufficient to
know that she was <i>de trop</i>&mdash;to the man, at any rate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helène, dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have had enough of
me for one day. Make your plans without considering
me. I expect Mr. Van Dusen this evening, so that I
cannot avail myself of Mr. Morton&#8217;s kind invitation.
You go. I am sure you and he must have a great deal
to talk about. Mr. Morton, let me thank you for including
me in your invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène seemed somewhat uneasy. Before, however,
she could reply to Margaret&#8217;s suggestion, she heard
Morton say:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>&#8220;You are quite right, Miss Fisher, Miss Barton and
I have a great many things to talk over. You are
very kind. Am I to have the pleasure, Miss Barton?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène had decided. &#8220;I shall be very pleased to dine
with you, Mr. Morton; but I do not care to see a play
for some time yet.&#8221; Then turning to Margaret she
asked: &#8220;You are sure, Margy, you don&#8217;t mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, my dear. Mr. Morton, I have acted
as guardian to Helen for the past five months, and
have been very strict, as you see. Perhaps I have
been selfish; but Helen has been nowhere without me.
She is very dear to me. You may, therefore, consider
it a great compliment that I am willing to place
this little treasure of mine in your care. But you must
promise that you will look after her, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am honored, Miss Fisher, and beg to assure you
that I deeply appreciate your trust. I shall take your
place with Miss Barton.&#8221; Morton smiled, fully appreciating
this unusual anxiety on Miss Fisher&#8217;s part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you excuse me now, for a few minutes, while
I &#8217;phone to my mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret followed him with her eyes as Morton
wound his way between the tables. Helène sat gazing
dreamily out of the window absorbed in her thoughts.
Margaret turned to her friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear, am I to know all about him? I am
bursting with curiosity, you know; but don&#8217;t tell me
more than you care to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène turned her clear, honest eyes on her friend&#8217;s
face. &#8220;There is not very much to tell, Margy. I
met Mr. Morton about a year ago under unusual circumstances.
He was a friend of my father&#8217;s. My
father died since then, and you are the one friend I
have now. Mr. Morton was very kind to me at the
time, and I believe was willing to assume certain responsibilities
on my behalf, for my father&#8217;s sake. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
promised that I would let him know this autumn how
I had fared, and it was only this morning that I sent
him the letter which he has not yet received. I shall
tell him now all that has happened to me, and he may
be able to give me news of old friends abroad. Did
you really intend to go out with Mr. Van Dusen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear. I was going to tell you about it, and
now it will be pleasant for both of us. Your Mr. Morton,
Helen, is the real swell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène laughed. &#8220;Yes, I suppose that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d
call him. But to me he has been a fine friend&mdash;the
best I have had&mdash;except you, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I accept the compliment. But&mdash;you know
what the old song says: &#8216;A girl&#8217;s best friend is her
lover.&#8217; I can see, Helen, where I pass out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Margy!&#8221; she exclaimed, adjusting her veil
quickly.</p>

<p>Morton&#8217;s return at that moment ended the confidences
between the girls. He was now, he told them,
entirely at their service. It was then arranged that
he should call for Helène at seven o&#8217;clock at the address
given him by Margaret.</p>

<p>Helène&#8217;s hand lingered an instant in Morton&#8217;s at
parting, and as he saw her happy face he knew that
he was welcome.</p>

<p>Morton drove to his rooms. Events had been crowding
on him and he wanted to be alone. On his way
he stopped at a florist&#8217;s and ordered flowers to be sent
to the house in Gramercy Park.</p>

<p>Once in his room he drew a deep chair to the
window and after lighting a cigar sat down to his
thoughts.</p>

<p>How beautiful she was! More beautiful than even
he had pictured her in his dreams. This evening she
would tell him everything and explain why she had
kept herself away from him. And how pleased she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
had been to see him! One look at her face had assured
him that no other man had come between them. She
must have carried out her intention and come to New
York to work for her living. That explained Miss
Fisher. By George, that woman was a splendid protectress!
He had no fault to find with her&mdash;not in the
slightest. Yes&mdash;he must put off his Western journey,
now.</p>

<p>John rose and began walking the room, whistling
and smoking by turns, smiling happily. His valet in
the next room could hardly believe his ears. He came
obedient to a summons and was ordered to lay out
evening clothes. Mr. Morton would stay in town over
Saturday night. What had come over his master?</p>

<p>John had told his mother that he would be detained
in town that night and promised to be with her for
luncheon the next day. He had laughed to himself
as he thought of the guessing match that would follow,
between mother and daughter. Ah, if they only
knew!</p>

<p>He dressed with great care and took a hansom,
thinking it would be more fitting than his own more
pretentious carriage, and as he drove down the avenue
he could not forbear smiling at his thought&mdash;he was
just like any ordinary young &#8220;chap&#8221; calling on his
&#8220;best girl.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Margaret and Helène, after leaving Morton and finishing
their shopping, arrived home, their arms filled
with packages, most happily expectant. An evening
such as this promised to be to each of them was a
rare occasion. Helène had been afraid that Margaret
would question her further, but to her surprise and relief,
she made no reference to Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, Helen, dear, you must let me help to dress
your hair,&#8221; she said quietly, &#8220;your hat will sit better.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>Helène sensed a slight coldness in her friend; she
came over to Margaret and seating herself on the arm
of her chair, cuddled up to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margy, dear, you are not disapproving, are you?
Do you think I ought not to dine with Mr. Morton
this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret held her tight and patted her shoulder
affectionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t mind me, dearie; I suppose I&#8217;m a jealous
old thing. It&#8217;s perfectly right to go out with Mr.
Morton, and I&#8217;m glad you are going. I&#8217;ve been selfish;
you&#8217;d get quite rusty if you allowed me to monopolize
you. There now, little girl, hurry and get
dressed and when you are ready call me.&#8221; And Margaret
kissed her affectionately.</p>

<p>Helène knew that her friend had only her good at
heart and thought it wisest to say nothing more. She
went to her room, though not to dress. Her mind had
been so disturbed by the sudden meeting with Morton
and she was so excited over it, that she felt she must
regain her composure. She took out her box of treasures
containing the dried leaves of flowers and a few
letters and sat fingering them thoughtfully. What
passed through her mind it would be too curious to
inquire. The thoughts of a girl are sacred to herself.
All we need to know is that she did not sit long, but
stole quietly to the mirror and looked earnestly at her
face and then with a sigh of satisfaction, turned away
with a happy smile.</p>

<p>Margaret, in her room, could hear her humming a
pretty melody, the words of which she could not make
out; but, certainly, they were not those of a dirge.
When she responded to Helène&#8217;s call she found her
ready and saw spread on the bed the latest acquisition&mdash;a
gray silk dress. Margaret pretended not to
notice it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>Indifferently at first she began her task of dressing
Helène&#8217;s hair; but gradually the feel of the silken
tresses, almost human in their touch, brought her back
to her true self. With a sudden movement she leaned
forward and kissing the cheek before her, whispered:
&#8220;I am so glad you are going to wear that dress&mdash;you
must look your prettiest to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène gave her a glad look and smiled. The two
were once again dear friends and each felt the happier
for it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kane came in bearing two boxes of flowers.
&#8220;From Thornley&#8217;s,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;we sure have some
swell admirers, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221; Her face was beaming.
Not for anything would she have foregone the pleasure
of bringing in the flowers. She also saw the dress and
catching Margaret&#8217;s eye she gave her a meaning look.
How quickly women seize at the little straws floating
on the swift current!</p>

<p>The box addressed &#8220;Miss Barton&#8221; contained some
magnificent roses on long stems. Margaret gave an
exclamation of admiration. Then taking out a large
bouquet of violets she held them out to Helène: &#8220;To
match your eyes, my dear,&#8221; she laughingly remarked,
with a low curtsey.</p>

<p>At last both were ready to their mutual satisfaction,
though not before Margaret had made a careful
survey of Helène from all sides to make certain
that she had received the finishing touches that would
heighten her darling&#8217;s charms. Then she had to leave,
because Mr. Van Dusen had arrived and was waiting
for her in the parlor.</p>

<p>The Mr. Van Dusen who had now become a regular
frequenter at the Kane boarding-house was a different
gentleman from the dapper young man of the
summer. His visits to Margaret had become the talk
of the table. Helène, however, was the only one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
seemed to see nothing of a special purpose in his calls.
She always took him as a matter of course. Under
Margaret&#8217;s influence, no doubt, Van Dusen&#8217;s manner
had lost its flippancy and air of condescension. He
had gained both in reserve and tact, so much so, indeed,
that in his intercourse with Margaret, it was he
who played the part of the serious friend and she that
of the light-hearted tease. To see them as they sat
in the parlor one would have said that Van Dusen was
undoubtedly a man of experience and good sense.</p>

<p>Margaret had not failed to notice the improvement.
She was glad of the change and her lightness of manner
may have been part of her strategy to bring out
the stronger nature she knew he possessed. She
told him of her meeting with Helène&#8217;s friend and the
luncheon at the Waldorf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was he?&#8221; inquired Van Dusen somewhat
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a very handsome man, evidently rich, and
looked like a Westerner and with the nicest manners
and voice. He is a&mdash;Mr. Morton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how did he come to know Miss Barton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They met abroad some time ago. He didn&#8217;t seem
sure of her name, because he called her by a word that
sounded like Countess. What do you make of it? I
didn&#8217;t like to ask Helène more than she cared to tell
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Van Dusen sat looking down thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said after a pause, &#8220;I always had
an idea that Miss Barton was not any ordinary young
woman. She is so different, don&#8217;t you know. I&#8217;ll
wager she&#8217;s some aristocrat. Poor girl, she must have
gone through great trouble. Did she show any sign
of anxiety when he spoke to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, on the contrary, she was very surprised and
then very pleased. She kept on blushing whenever he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
spoke to her&mdash;and he&mdash;well he sat looking at her as if
he couldn&#8217;t take his eyes off her face. I was afraid
he&#8217;d forget himself and begin making love to her right
in the restaurant. If ever a man was in love with a
girl that Mr. Morton is with Helène, or I don&#8217;t know
anything about men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Mr. Morton&#8217;s business, do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t, and I believe Helen doesn&#8217;t know
either. He&#8217;s a gentleman, there&#8217;s no doubt about that,
and as good-looking as they make &#8217;em. His face seems
familiar as if I had seen him before; but I can&#8217;t place
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you thinking of a portrait of a Mr. Morton
you saw in the newspapers, Miss Margaret?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret stared at him for a moment and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it! You struck it! That&#8217;s just where I did
see that face. It&#8217;s a strong face with a slightly drooping
mustache and gray eyes so calm that you feel
small as you look into them. That&#8217;s the very man!
Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Van Dusen, &#8220;if he&#8217;s the Mr. Morton
whose portrait was in the &#8216;Tribune&#8217; the other day,
he&#8217;s John R. Morton of Cleveland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me you&#8217;ve never heard of
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never did, and I am sure Helen never reads
the papers carefully enough to have seen it. But don&#8217;t
look so surprised at me&mdash;who is he&mdash;some criminal
or a politician?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord,&#8221; groaned Van Dusen, &#8220;this beats anything
I ever heard. Why, John R. Morton is the only
son and successor of old Dan Morton; he&#8217;s just the biggest
man in New York&mdash;and some man! You know
my governor is no piker when it comes to dollars, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Morton&mdash;why all the blue bloods of New York are
not in the same class with him. He could buy and sell
them all without the wink of an eyelash. I&#8217;ve met him
at the Metropolitan Club this summer. He&#8217;s a biggish
fellow, about 33, a couple of inches shorter than I am.
Talks like a professor, gentle and quiet. By George!
I remember now. There was something in the papers
about his being mixed up in some foreign business with
revolutions and princesses. I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if
he&#8217;s the man. No wonder Miss Barton turned me
down. Why, John Morton is the greatest catch in
the country and as fine a fellow as ever stood in shoe
leather, so they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret suddenly realized that she had not been
wise to open the conversation on a matter which concerned
Helène alone. Indeed, she had done wrong, she
felt, especially as she had not pressed Helène herself
for information. She was deeply vexed at her indiscretion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, a moment, Mr. Van Dusen,&#8221; she said
quickly, &#8220;while I get my coat. I shall not be long.
Helen will not be down this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting she walked rapidly out of the
room. The door closed behind her, she became at once
thoughtful. No&mdash;she would say nothing to Helen of
what she had been told. Besides, she did not know
how to broach the subject without betraying herself.
She put on her coat and opening Helène&#8217;s door she
looked in and called out smilingly: &#8220;I&#8217;ll sit up for you,
dear.&#8221; Before Helène could reply the door had been
closed and Margaret was running down the stairs.</p>

<p>Helène heard the front door slam and knew that
she would have to face the coming ordeal alone. How
she dreaded the announcement of Mr. Morton&#8217;s arrival!
Mrs. Kane would draw her own conclusion
immediately. The new dress, the flowers, the elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
preparations&mdash;well, Mrs. Kane must think what
she liked! It could not be helped now. To-morrow
would be the twenty-first of September&mdash;the last day
of summer. She glanced at the royal roses crowding
the vase, their heads proudly erect as if in challenge to
the world. Then her eyes fell on the sweet purple of
the violets on the table&mdash;&#8220;The last rose of summer,&#8221;
she murmured; &#8220;but the violet is blue&mdash;true blue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her watch told her that it was still some minutes
before the time. She must not betray any anxiety or
show any undue haste. She would wait ... ah&mdash;the
electric bell was ringing. A deep voice, his voice,
reached her above the hum of talk&mdash;then quick steps
ascending and a knock at her door brought Nora,
the maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barton, Mr. Morton is waiting in the parlor.&#8221;</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BRILLIANT lights flooded the gallery adjacent
to the sumptuous dining-room from which
it was separated by a balustrade of palms.
The tables were occupied by men in sombre evening
dress, setting off to greater advantage the bright costumes
of the ladies who sat with them. The air palpitated
with the hum of talk, the peals of light laughter,
the clinking of silver and glass and the music of
a string orchestra. The perfumes of flowers, the
odors of viands and the scent of tobacco smoke rose
like the incense from a burnt-offering. The place was
typical of one of the more select of the restaurants
in the best sections of New York.</p>

<p>At a small table sat Helène and Morton facing each
other. Helène&#8217;s face was radiant with a happiness
that was reflected from Morton&#8217;s eyes as he gazed at
her&mdash;and her only. Morton had quite forgotten the
months of anxiety of the spring and summer, he had
cast into oblivion the many questions he had intended
to ask. It was enough for him that she was there,
facing him, happy and her dear self again. He was
wishing he could tell her all he felt and all he could
not repress in his face. As a matter of fact, however,
he was conversing with her just as any man would do
who might be dining at Berry&#8217;s with a lady. But he
was not conscious of the power habit gave him to hide
his emotions.</p>

<p>Helène&#8217;s modest frock was quite in contrast to the
costly and elaborate gowns of the ladies near her.
Those of the sisterhood who sent occasional searching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
glances at her wished they had the courage to wear so
simple a dress and to look so beautiful in it. The
men eyed her in open admiration, and the waiters evidently
were of the same opinion, for they were most
deferential and suave to the slender girl in dove gray
with the violets in her corsage.</p>

<p>To Morton the fresh beauty of Helène grew so
overpowering in its insistency that he put his feelings
into words before he knew what he was saying:
&#8220;You are bewitching, to-night, Comtesse,&#8221; he
breathed, &#8220;wonderfully so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène&#8217;s face suffused with blushes while she gave
him a quick look of surprise; but the next moment
she smiled and her smile was like a ray of sunlight
through a rift in the clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dress is pretty, is it not?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am
glad now I had the courage to wear it. I did not
expect you would take me to so fashionable a place as
this seems to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton said nothing, but looked volumes. He dared
not to say any more; he dreaded a return of shyness
and timidity in her, and yet he hoped it would not
pass away. He saw the two pretty little hands resting
flower-like on the white damask, fingering a fork,
and an impulse came over him to take them in his own
and tell her there and then, of his love and his heart&#8217;s
desires. But the primitive man in him held him back;
it was so delightful to watch the ebb and flow of shy
reserve and unconscious expression in the sweet
mobile face. What is it in the human male that
prompts him to seek this peculiar pleasure, as of a
cat playing with a mouse? Morton would have been
highly indignant had any one dared so to characterize
his attitude at this moment and he would have been
justified, because he was as much the victim as the
victimizer&mdash;he was simply obeying the compulsion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
the moment, enjoying in anticipation the pleasure that
he somehow was convinced the future held for him.</p>

<p>The current of his emotions must have leaked
through some faulty insulation and induced a corresponding
current in Helène, for she suddenly became
reserved and shy again. She sought refuge in
a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you of my adventures after I left Weimar?&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>The waiter had deposited two high-stemmed glasses
filled with a pale liquid before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am most anxious to hear everything,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;but first let us drink to good luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his glass and watched her take a dainty
sip of the <i>apéritif</i> and then with a puzzled expression
replace the glass on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your very good health, Comtesse Helène,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and may we always be good friends,&#8221; and emptied
his glass.</p>

<p>The orchestra had struck up a new piece. She listened
intently for a moment to the first few bars,
and then her face lightened and the tears came to her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear, Mr. Morton, do you remember, it&#8217;s
&#8216;The Blue Danube.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember well. We heard it at the Bristol
in Vienna on the day I left for home,&#8221; he whispered
back hastily, overcome with the emotion born of the
recollection. The next moment, however, he was the
courtly host again. It was the present, not the past,
that concerned him just now.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, Miss Helène, may I hear your story?&#8221;</p>

<p>At first hesitatingly, then somewhat more fluently
and occasionally with a rush of words, she began and
continued the story we know. When she came to the
incident with the Frau Professor in Hanover, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
scarcely knew how to relate it without conveying a
false impression about herself to Morton. But he
realized the situation without her assistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can fully appreciate the Frau Professor&#8217;s
motives,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the poor woman, worried and harassed
by cares, had become soured by her life. Many
other women would have been only too glad to avail
themselves of your services; but you know, Miss
Helène, Germany demands diplomas and references
more than she does ability. But go on with your
tale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène then told of her meeting with Margaret
Fisher and told it so enthusiastically that she forgot
the excellent food before her. Then came the voyage
to America and her adventures in New York. When
she had finished, she looked at Morton, searching his
face for a sign of interest or reproach; but what she
saw there made her cast her eyes down quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not think I did right, Mr. Morton, in
coming to America?&#8221; she asked, playing with the ice
before her, &#8220;or did I act too hastily?&#8221; There was a
pleading note in her voice. She had not intended to
say the words, but her confusion consequent on seeing
the expression in Morton&#8217;s face threw her back on an
instinct which women possess and which they exercise
in self-protection, the instinct which appeals to the
man and acknowledges his superiority.</p>

<p>Morton did not reply at once, but busied himself
slowly pouring out the coffee&mdash;the one menial office
a man permits himself at a dinner-table&mdash;and took the
time thus granted him to reflect on what he should
say. This was the point which he had been hoping to
reach in order to discover her real motives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under the circumstances, Miss Helène,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I think I would have acted as you did. But why the
secrecy towards Mr. and Mrs. Tyler, both of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
had become greatly attached to you? And why did
you not let me know? Surely we had done nothing
to deserve your displeasure! Ah, Miss Helène, how
I searched for you and scoured the most unlikely
places in my efforts to find you! Why did you do
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton&#8217;s face expressed his grievance and he could
not repress a slight tremor in his voice.</p>

<p>Helène had become white at his words of reproach.
She struggled with herself to regain composure and
find a fitting answer. About them everything had
become suddenly quiet and she felt as if everybody in
the room were looking at them. For an instant she
gave a frightened glance around to see if her feelings
had been justified; but she found the same people
there, all absolutely unconscious of her. Immediately
she realized that the place was her best protection.
Alone with him she would have confessed
herself&mdash;here, in the crowd, she could tell him only
what she judged proper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember, Mr. Morton, that we had
agreed to wait until the autumn? To-night is still
summer&mdash;my dress and the lovely violets bear witness
to that. Why should we not enjoy the season while it
is still with us? This is my first dinner <i>en fête</i>&mdash;will
you not allow me to taste its pleasure to the full without
scolding me? If I have been naughty, be kind to-night,
<i>mon chevalier</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She breathed the last two words and looked at him
pleadingly, her lips tremulous, the blue eyes shining.
Without saying a word, Morton bent over and kissed
the hand on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; his voice was husky with emotion,
&#8220;I am a brute. Of course, it shall be as you
say. And, after all, what does anything matter? You
are here, safe and well, and I&mdash;I am fortune&#8217;s favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
in the privilege you have extended to me this evening.
To-night, as you have said, is still summer. I
shall match the sunshine in your eyes with the warm
friendship in my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, dear friend,&#8221; whispered Helène with
drooping lashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to-morrow, Miss Helène, is another summer&#8217;s
day. Will you not give me a second opportunity to act
as your escort? Let me take you to our home in
Tarrytown. My mother will welcome you, and you
and Ruth&mdash;do you remember my little sister?&mdash;you
two can roam as you please in the park and woods.
It promises to be a beautiful day. Will you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very kind, Mr. Morton. I don&#8217;t know
what to say. I have thought of your sister with the
pretty name, very often. Does she know of my existence?&#8221;</p>

<p>How utterly different is the trend of women&#8217;s minds
from men&#8217;s, thought Morton. He had not dared to
bare his soul even to Ruth, and yet Helène took it
for granted that he had spoken of her, and she was,
perhaps, speculating at this very moment, if his description
of her had been favorable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to be my surprise to them, Miss
Helène, if you will. You have become so thoroughly
Americanized that I doubt if my mother will guess at
your identity, though she knows I met you in Europe.
But Ruth knows nothing, and she will throw her
slang at you as she would at any New York girl she
knows. So permit me to introduce you merely as a
friend without any further explanations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Morton, they will know immediately I
am a foreigner&mdash;my first words will tell the tale&mdash;they
always do. Still, I will accept your invitation
gladly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied Morton simply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me about your mother and sister?&#8221;
Helène asked shyly.</p>

<p>Morton laughed; the question was a natural one for
one girl to put to another, but to him, a man, it was a
puzzling one to answer. However, he entered into the
spirit of her curiosity and told her what he thought
would interest her. Helène had become quite animated
now, and Morton enjoyed keenly watching the
sweet play of her features, the dainty gestures of her
little hands, so slender and soft and dimpled, as he
told her of his home life in his quiet unassuming manner.
His eyes kept looking at the finger which he
was hoping some day to adorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not getting late, Mr. Morton?&#8221; Helène&#8217;s
voice broke in on his thoughts with a seeming suddenness
that startled him. &#8220;Margy will be waiting
for me, and I must not keep her up late. If I abuse
my present privilege, she&#8217;ll not let me go another time.
Margy is very strict, you know. Sometimes I think
she is jealous. Oh, but we&#8217;ve been so happy together,
and she&#8217;s been so good and so patient. I can never
hope to repay her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Fisher is a fine young woman,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It was a Providence that sent her to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>To himself he thought that if the buxom Margaret
were his only rival, he could afford to be gracious.
And as for her jealousy&mdash;well&mdash;he could well understand
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you ask Margaret to come with me, Mr.
Morton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall willingly do so, if you wish,&#8221; he replied
with a slight dropping of his voice; &#8220;but if you came
alone it would fit in better with our plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton thought he saw a threatening cloud in the
distance. &#8220;Go slow, old man, go slow,&#8221; he said to
himself, &#8220;let her do the talking.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>To his surprise, however, she dropped the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do we start?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good train at 9:40. Will it be too early
if I call for you a little after nine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, we breakfast early on Sunday. Shall we
go now, Mr. Morton?&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton settled the bill and the two left followed by
the admiring glances of the late diners in the room.
John&#8217;s vanity had been suppressed from an early day;
his training and habit of mind had made him indifferent
to what people might say of him. But as he
walked across the spacious salon he could not help
noticing the looks sent in Helène&#8217;s direction, and
felt quite proud. Yes, the girl was worth admiring,
he said to himself.</p>

<p>The fairy of the afternoon must have been near them
all the time, for in spite of the salaaming manager at
the exit and the cry of &#8220;Cab, sir?&#8221; from a waiting
driver, Morton was compelled to turn his head away
and look up at the big moon floating in the spangled
blackness of the gorge&#8217;s roof. A voice seemed to
whisper to him: &#8220;Make hay while the moon shines.&#8221;
Instantly he had taken Helène by the arm and though
his heart beat within him he said, in a most matter-of-fact
tone: &#8220;Shall we walk? It&#8217;s a delightful evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of a certainty the fairy was at work; for the cool
air was laden with the scent of the meadows across
the river and touched with the dew distilled of youth&#8217;s
innocent hearts. Margaret was forgotten, the night
was bathed in beauty and the bell of a neighboring
clock lost one of its strokes in the reverberating
sounds from the cañon&#8217;s sky-scrapered sides.</p>

<p>It is good to be young and to be pure in heart;
for then we stand well in the esteem of the fairies of
our land. Morton trembled at the touch of Helène&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
arm as he walked by her side, breathing in the cool,
scented breeze, and realized, for the first time in his
life, that he was, indeed, rich.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the shadowed doorway of the
boarding-house, Helène gave a quick look upward
and saw a light in the window of her sitting-room.
She felt guilty and a little afraid. John stood for a
moment, hat in hand, and took the dear hand in his
own warm, friendly grip. Then bowing deeply he
touched it with his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, Miss Helène, and pleasant dreams attend
you. I shall call in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, Mr. Morton, and thank you for a
most enjoyable evening. I hope these violets will
keep. I should like to wear them to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton smiled and watched her go up the steps.
The door opened. Helène turned to the still waiting
man standing bareheaded in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, Mr. Morton,&#8221; she cried in her happy
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, Miss Barton,&#8221; but his words were
drowned in the sound of the closing door.</p>

<p>He looked up at the light in her window for a
moment and then, replacing his hat, walked slowly
away.</p>

<p>Helène tripped up the stairs rapidly and almost
rushed into the sitting-room ready with an explanation
to Margaret for her late return; but although the
light was brightly burning, no Margaret was there.
She looked into the bedroom but she was not there
either. Where was she? What had detained her?
It was so unusual for her not to keep her word. Well,
she would wait until she arrived. The soft arm-chair
was inviting and Helène was not sorry to be alone
and dream over the wonderful events of this wonderful
day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>But where was Margery? Ah, that is another
story. Shortly after leaving the boarding-house, she
and Van Dusen were comfortably seated at a table in
a restaurant very similar to the one in which Helène
and Morton had spent such intimate hours. Miss
Fisher, the buxom damsel, and Van Dusen, the gilded
youth of Gotham&#8217;s pride, may not have appeared to
the ordinary eye as fit subjects for romance, but the
ordinary eye is ordinary just because it does not see
below the surface of things and people. We, who are
not ordinary, see more deeply and know better,
which is our reason for being present at this second
dinner also.</p>

<p>Van Dusen had evidently made up his mind, though
it would seem he lacked somewhat of courage. He
had had his cocktail and not a few glasses of wine.
Margaret had not failed to notice his nervousness
and the frequency with which he refilled his glass, but
she said nothing and tried to look unconcerned. She
was herself nervous; her usual self-possession and
poise seemed to have left her. She had tried on previous
occasions to restrain him but to-night he was
more than usually reckless.</p>

<p>As the wine began mounting to his head, he became
more and more sentimental and more and more
talkative, and unbosomed himself to her of his hopes
and aspirations. He called her Margy and dearest
Margy, and laying his large bony hand with its prominent
knuckles over her plump one, he fastened on her
ox-like eyes that gleamed amorously. He was pleading
his cause with her.</p>

<p>Margaret, full of doubt and distress, with her lips
tightly compressed and her bosom rising and falling in
her agitation, knew not which way to turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margy, dear,&#8221; he said almost tearfully, &#8220;I know
you haven&#8217;t much faith in my protestations and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
you think me fickle; but you are unjust to me&mdash;honestly
you are. I know I&#8217;ve been a fool; but I&#8217;ve been
cured of my folly. Margy, I want you&mdash;only you.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you, Margy. Give me a chance to prove it,
won&#8217;t you? You always understood me better than
any girl I&#8217;ve ever met. I know now that it was
you I really cared for from the first&mdash;really I do. I
know it sounds silly to say so, but my running after
your little friend was only a momentary fancy&mdash;an
impulse of admiration, and not love. Instead of being
unhappy, I was glad she refused me. Margy, don&#8217;t
let that silly business prejudice you against me. I
don&#8217;t amount to much; but I want to be somebody,
and&mdash;you can help me. There isn&#8217;t anybody like you&mdash;and
you can do what you will with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused while his exploring hand groped for
hers: &#8220;Say something, Margy. Say you will believe
me and give me a trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret had kept her eyes all the time fixed on
the table; she raised them now and looked full into his
now thoroughly serious, pale face. The earnestness
she saw there was as evident as it was unexpected.
Was she wise in permitting him to talk like this?
And yet, after all, he was a man and should know his
own mind. She could but admit to herself that he had
been very kind, very courteous to her, and what he
said was really true&mdash;he had been marked in his attentions
to her from the first time they had met. He
was young&mdash;but that was only in manner, not in
years. And, she could not help confessing that she
liked him better than any other man she had known.</p>

<p>Van Dusen sensed her kindlier feelings for him from
the changing expressions in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Margy,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;mother likes you. She
says you are the most sensible and wholesome girl she
has ever met. Only last night she told me that I needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
a girl like you to wake me up and keep me straight. I
know she will be glad if you will have me&mdash;honest,
she will!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment Margaret&mdash;the strong, big, wholesome
Margaret&mdash;forgot all her doubts, forgot her oft-repeated
vows to celibacy, forgot everything except that
she was lonely and still young, that Howard was the
kindest of men, and that it would be pleasant to take
care of him, to make a good husband and a successful
man out of this spoiled boy. She looked at his face
and noticed that his hair had become disordered in his
excitement and felt an irrepressible desire to brush it
straight. She hesitated what to say&mdash;began to temporize
with herself&mdash;and ended where all end who hesitate&mdash;by
being lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really care for me so much?&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;I never, never thought you did.&#8221; Howard
made an impulsive movement towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, remember, we are in a public place. Don&#8217;t
lean over and look at me like that. Please, sit up
straight and let us be calm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, tell me, Margy, that you care for me. Tell
me that you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret admitted that she was very fond of him&mdash;and
immediately felt very happy.</p>

<p>He made another movement to get nearer to her.
&#8220;Please, please, remember where we are!&#8221; And to her
own surprise she burst into tears.</p>

<p>Quickly drying her eyes, she whispered: &#8220;Do you
really love me, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Howard disregarded all injunctions.
Leaning over the table he almost sent the solitary sugar
bowl between them sliding to the carpeted floor, and
whispered in her ear: &#8220;Shall we go, dearest?&#8221; The
question sounded ridiculously inane, but it had a very
practical import.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>Proudly and with a new-born sense of protection,
he assisted her with her coat and walked with her to
the door. To the boy who handed him his hat and
cane he gave all the change his large fist could grab.
Flushed with victory and anticipatory happiness, he
followed the tall, striking figure of the girl into the
street.</p>

<p>Once outside, he lost not a moment in drawing her
hand through his arm and leading her down the quieter
side street. Where they walked or what they said to
each other neither of them knew. The evening was
balmy and the little park in Madison Square a quiet
haven with most accommodating benches in the deep
shadows. And as the benches can neither see nor speak
nor hear, what transpired there was, therefore, never
recorded.</p>

<p>When Margaret reached the house in Gramercy
Park, she found it as quiet as a church. The vestibule,
that time-honored institution of America, the ever-ready
refuge for laughing swains and coy maidens, was
inviting and bright. Margaret did not see the fantastic
designs on Howard&#8217;s face made by the arabesques
etched on the glass panels of the door, nor did he see
anything but her sweet eyes and arched lips. And
here they sealed their plighted troth; here they made
their plans for the morrow&#8217;s new-coming happiness.
John Morton need have no fear about Margaret going
with Helène. The good fairy had done his day&#8217;s work
most excellently well.</p>

<p>Helène was sitting in comfortable deshabille, waiting
for Margaret. She had almost made up her mind
to chide the lax duenna for her dereliction of duty.
But when she saw Margaret open the door she greeted
her as if a midnight home-coming were a common occurrence
in their lives.</p>

<p>And Margaret? Margaret carefully locked the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
and then walked straight up to Helène. She knelt
down before her, put her arms about her and kissed
her without giving utterance to a single word.</p>

<p>For a few moments the two rested thus in close
embrace, and then Helène, the inexperienced, innocent
child-woman, kissed her dear friend and stroking her
cheek and hair, murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad from my heart, dearest, that it has come.
I am sure you will both be very, very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who had told her? Ah, who knows?</p>

<p>The workings of a woman&#8217;s brain are mysterious,
her moods subtle, and the communion between one
woman&#8217;s mind and another&#8217;s ever a miracle. The instant
she had spoken Helène felt that she had always
known that Van Dusen loved Margaret; nay, that he
could not help loving her. And yet, a moment before
she would have denied vehemently the possibility of
her entertaining even a suspicion of such a thought.
Scientists may write volumes about the feminine brain;
they may dissect and weigh it as much as they please&mdash;their
experiments will but bear witness to their futility,
for their analyses will have been in vain. It is
wisest not to analyse but simply to bow down and
accept this perfect organism. Man may intellectualize
and reason; but woman knows, and she never questions
how or why she knows.</p>

<p>Margaret, her head against Helène&#8217;s breast was crying
softly and protesting that she would never leave her
darling, never forsake her so long as Helène wanted
her. Helène said nothing, but sat still and allowed the
girl to kiss and embrace her. Her sympathetic silence
had its beneficent influence, and when Margaret had
quieted down, Helène said to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Margy, dear, it is the best that could come to you.
I have known it all along. You must think now only of
your own happiness. And now, good night, Margy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
dear, it is very late and we must be up early in the
morning. Happy dreams be with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène lay in her bed thinking, not of her friend&#8217;s
new-found happiness, but of the morning&#8217;s meeting,
and the visit to Morton&#8217;s home. She was anxious
about the impression she would make on his mother
and sister and painfully timid of the ordeal. Of Morton
himself she had no fear&mdash;he had been so kind, so
happy to meet her. There was but one problem with
regard to him she had still left unsolved&mdash;it related
to the money in the bank at Weimar. She was at a
loss how to broach the subject and how to dispose of
it once and for all. She lay awake for a long time
turning it over in her mind again and again. She decided
finally that she would speak of it at the first opportunity
and have done with it. She would not then
be his debtor, and would feel free of the burden it had
been to her.</p>

<p>Comforted by this decision, she closed her eyes and
with a happy sigh slept peacefully the deep and
strengthening sleep of a mind at rest.</p>

<p>Margaret sat for a long time going over in her mind
all that happened to her on this momentous evening.
She was doing battle with herself to subjugate
the doubts that kept assailing her as to the step she
had taken. For, indeed, she had gone through a wonderful
metamorphosis. Yesterday, an ordinary working
girl&mdash;to-day, the affianced of a Van Dusen! A
few hours ago she was a confirmed spinster, and now
she was happy in the possession of the truest lover a
girl was ever blessed with. Her eyes fell on the finger
of her left hand on which shone a gorgeous diamond&mdash;his
betrothal ring. He had had it ready in his pocket&mdash;nay,
as he told her, he had had it there for weeks,
waiting until he could muster up the courage to speak
to her. What a man!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>She began slowly to undress, speculating the while
as to whether or no she should wear the ring in the
morning. What would Mrs. Kane and the others say?
She extinguished the light, but not before she had
taken a last admiring and loving look at the glittering
gem, and crept into her bed. Should she remove the
ring or wear it? The pillow was soft and soothing.
She stretched her limbs luxuriously. Should she wear
the ring or&mdash;her eyes closed in sleep.</p>

<p>Sleep, dear girl; sleep and dream of the happiness
that has at last come to you. Your brave spirit shall
soon receive its reward. Love, with which you blessed,
will bless you.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE harvest moon that had smiled so benignly
upon New York in all its fullness the evening
before had proved a false prophet. The wind
had shifted to the east and brought a copious rainfall
during the early morning hours, and it was still
drizzling when Morton&#8217;s carriage drew up before the
Gramercy Park house.</p>

<p>The feelings of Helène, who had risen early, and
in high spirits, had begun to oscillate while awaiting
the arrival of Morton, alternating between looking
forward with hopeful expectancy to meeting the ladies
of whom she had thought so often, and the dread of
a possible unfavorable impression she might create.</p>

<p>Laboring under these depressing doubts, her greeting
of Morton appeared less spontaneous than he in
his optimism had anticipated. The exchange of salutations
became quite formal, his compliment on her appearance
sounded commonplace. When, during the
short drive to the Grand Central Station, he once more
and rather soberly expressed his regret that their outing
had begun in such unpromising weather, Helène
turned to him with a somewhat pathetic smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind the rain at all. I think I am really
frightened at the prospect of meeting Mrs. Morton and
your sister!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear child&mdash;you need not worry on that score!
They can&#8217;t help but like you, and I am quite confident
that you will like them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You give me courage, Mr. Morton&mdash;I do hope you
will prove to be right!&#8221; Helène&#8217;s smile had now lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
its pathos, anticipating to Morton the breaking of the
sunshine through the clouds which was promised by
a rapidly widening strip of heavenly blue.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room of the now quickly moving
train, Helène found the opportunity she had been waiting
for so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton&mdash;I want to speak to you on a matter
which has been constantly on my mind. It relates to
that money in the Weimar bank. I cannot accept it&mdash;it
is not rightfully mine. Please withdraw what of it
is yours. I cannot take money from you, really I
cannot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton was not surprised. He had expected some
such outbreak as this. In the stillness of the past night,
in which he had devoted some hours to his &#8220;Hellenic
studies,&#8221; he had once again read the girl&#8217;s last letter
to him, and while in the blissful state of having found
her, had also decided what he would do should she
speak of this matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Barton, you told me yesterday that you had
written to me to Cleveland. The letter should reach
me in two days. In that letter, I presume, you accept
the injunctions laid upon you by your father? Am I
right?&#8221; Helène, who had been anxiously awaiting his
reply, nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father had enjoined me to act in his stead.
Consequently, I have become, so to say, your legal
guardian. Now, Miss Helène, as you are still a minor,
any action with reference to any property or money
you may own, lies with me. You surely do not question
my qualifications for this duty?&#8221; Helène gave
a protesting and frightened, &#8220;Oh&mdash;no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, then, suppose you leave this all to me
and to my office. When the proper time arrives, my
secretary will render you a full account. Until then,
please let us dismiss it!&#8221; The mouth of his vis-à-vis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
showed a decided droop, which made Morton immediately
change both his tone and tactics. Taking the
little hand that hung listlessly at her side, and giving
her his most brotherly smile, he said, as insinuatingly
as he knew how:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor child, you have been worrying all these
months without any real cause! You should have had
full confidence in your father&#8217;s wisdom and in me.
Now remember what you promised me last evening?
To-day is still summer, this is to be yours and Ruth&#8217;s
day. Brush away the wrinkles from your brow and
let us all be happy. See, the sun is shining again,
bright and warm. The country will look the better for
the rain. Even the elements are on their best behavior
in your honor, Miss Helène, and you should reciprocate!&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes met her searching glance unwaveringly.
She saw no guile in them and her heart found its happiness
in surrendering to his authority.</p>

<p>Helène and Morton were the sole occupants of the
lumbering &#8220;carry-all&#8221; that deposited them at the open
park gate. The gravel paths had dried, but the lawns
still glistened with myriads of dazzling rain-born gems.
The foliage of bush and tree shone with a renewed
gloss and the sweet scent of new-mown hay belied the
spring-morn redolence of the balmy air which was
filled with faint whispers of bird-song.</p>

<p>Helène breathed the gracious air and with care-free
heart tripped joyously by the side of her companion,
exclaiming her delight in the beauty of her surroundings.
Then both grew silent. The restfulness of the
garden, the peace of the Sabbath and the hush of memories
were upon them.</p>

<p>The path rose gradually. The sauntering pair advanced
slowly until, emerging from a group of thick
shrubbery, they caught the first glimpse of the majestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
river glistening in the broad sunlight. The charming
vista drew renewed admiration from Helène and
brought the suggestion from her companion that she
should rest upon a convenient stone seat in the deep
shade nearby.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have many things to talk about, Miss Helène,
and, I fear, once my mother meets you, I shall find
very little further opportunity. You have given me an
outline of your life during the past ten months, and
you have told me you are now quite happy. Will you
not tell me of your ambitions, of your work and,
perhaps, of your plans? This is a cozy spot, almost
made for friendly confidences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène&#8217;s eyes rose questioningly to his; but the calm
face beamed kindly and invitingly on her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, indeed, very happy, Mr. Morton. I have not
heard from either Weimar or Roumelia, so that I am
entirely out of touch with my old life. What has
been the fate of my country and my Princess? Perhaps
you can enlighten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused questioningly. Was she trying to gain
time? But surely, it was Morton&#8217;s turn to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last information I received from abroad,&#8221; replied
Morton, &#8220;said that the Princess Marie-Louise was
still at Weimar. Some ten days ago I had a letter
from Mr. Rosen, the first news from Roumelia since
we left it. Conditions there have at last begun to
improve somewhat; life has become bearable, he writes.
Miss Rachel is well. About the political state of the
country, however, he is silent. From Berlin come
rumors that the Royalist party is growing stronger
every day and that an important move may be expected
shortly. Would you wish to return to your own country,
Miss Helène?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no one left there, Mr. Morton, who would
claim me. And even if restitution were offered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
papa&#8217;s land should be returned to me&mdash;what could I
do there? No, Roumelia and I have parted forever,
I fear. This country, your country, Mr. Morton, has
opened to me a new vista in life, even if its prospects
are not quite clear. But to tell the truth, I have not
thought much of what is to come, and I have formed
no plans for the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>But John had his plans, however, but these lay hidden
in his breast, for the time had not yet come for
him to reveal them. He had his road cut out before
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am delighted to hear that our beautiful country
finds an admirer in you. It well deserves it. Do you
know, your remarks recall a curious prophecy pronounced
by your father in one of our frequent conversations.
He pointed out that history proves the constant
trend of progress from the East to the West,
and predicted that the most powerful commonwealths,
the most enlightened people will in future dwell in the
West. His words recurred to me the other night while
thinking over what a friend of mine, a prominent professor
of the city, had said to me on the subject of
telepathy. I was wishing I could speak to you by
means of this mysterious power, wishing I could bring
you nearer to me or know where I could find you.
And, behold, the very next day I met you! It must
have been this mysterious force of the &#8216;westward
trend&#8217; that brought you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flush suffused Helène&#8217;s face. &#8220;Then you did
sometimes think of me?&#8221; she asked shyly. &#8220;I see now
that it was wrong in me not to write. But, oh, I was
so ignorant of life&mdash;will you not forgive me? Happy
as I was with Margaret, the thought of my negligence
was never out of my mind&mdash;and&mdash;I corrected my
error just as soon as I could!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Helène, my dear child&mdash;all is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
that ends well!&#8221; He glanced about him; for he had
a sudden feeling that eyes were hidden in the bushes.
But all breathed rest and solitude, not a sound disturbed
the still air. &#8220;Miss Helène, we have still some
time before us. Mother and Ruth are at church. Let
us walk up to the brow of the hill, where you can get
a wider view of the river. It is but a few rods from
there to the house, and we can time our arrival by
observing my mother&#8217;s carriage drive up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène was chatting vivaciously now about her
interesting work, and was expressing her admiration
for the customs of this, her country by adoption. She
permitted Morton the full enjoyment of her confidences.
The path led to a low marble building patterned
after a Grecian temple, which occupied the
summit of the gentle hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is our goal, Miss Helène. Please do not
turn round until you are on the porch; to obtain the
full effect of the beauty of the view, it should come by
surprise!&#8221; She smiled up to him happily and, obedient
to his request, sat down on a wicker-bench he
drew towards her. The next moment a glad cry of
wonderment escaped her.</p>

<p>There before her gaze spread the broad river bordered
by luxurious trees, the waves of which shimmered
in the brilliant light of the sun now high above
them, and beyond the glorious waters the olive smoothness
of the hills on the opposite bank. The foreground,
a well-kept park, lost itself into neighboring
slopes equally parklike. On the waters, the one thing
in motion, an ungainly barge towed by a powerful
tug; and over all the quiet of leisure, the restfulness
of solitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Morton,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I am so grateful
to you for bringing me here. It is glorious! And to
think that we are but a few miles from the gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
city and its teaming millions! Wonderful! I see now
why your people love this place. Will you point out
your house to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The house is hidden beyond that slight swell to
your left. There, right under us, is the driveway.
Shall we sit here awhile? It is so quiet and restful&mdash;almost
like in a church, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; He found
a seat on one of the steps of the porch.</p>

<p>Helène, smiling assent, gratefully relaxed in her
seat. She was too happy to speak. She felt at peace
with herself and all the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Helène,&#8221; Morton broke into her reveries.
&#8220;Would you be interested to know what happened to
me since we parted? You have not inquired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am more than interested, only I had not the courage
to ask. Please tell me.&#8221; She placed her hands
together supplicatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I go further back than one year? I should
like to tell you about my earlier life. You may find it
entertaining.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing would please me more;&#8221; her animated eye
confirmed her words. Morton sat leaning against the
fluted column.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems a long time as I look back, but as a boy,
I was, no doubt, as fond of studies and athletics as
most boys; but somehow, I never became intimate with
my schoolmates. My father&#8217;s wealth prevented me,
for I was always reminded of it, and I resented it. It
was the same at college. Whenever I attempted to
embrace a friendship offered me, my father&#8217;s position
interfered. I don&#8217;t believe that the young men of my
country are any more devout worshipers of the Golden
Calf than those of the rest of the world; but I suppose
I was over-sensitive. At all events, I came in
time to hate wealth. I put down to that the loneliness
of my youth; for I became more and more a solitary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
In time this so grew on me that, after my graduation
from Harvard, I went abroad&mdash;to England and then
to Germany. There I devoted myself to literary and
scientific studies. Strange to say, the people there
were more willing to value me for what I was, and
I lived there some of the happiest days of my life. Do
I tire you with this autobiography, Miss Helène?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, Mr. Morton. I am greatly interested.
Please continue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I returned to Cleveland with the full intention of
entering one of my father&#8217;s enterprises. I had quite a
leaning towards engineering and had acquired considerable
knowledge of it. My father approved when I spoke
to him, but I could see that he did not believe I was
serious. He suspected that I had made the suggestion
to please him. I believe now he was right, because I
soon grew restless again. I tried travel for one year
and was attached to our Embassy in London&mdash;but
nothing satisfied me. Again I returned to America
and assisted my father in some work in the Rocky
Mountains; but <i>wanderlust</i> once more seized me and I
went to the Soudan. It was on my return from that
place that I met and came to know the Count, your
father.&#8221; Morton paused and locked his hands over
his knee; then he continued in a softer voice: &#8220;To
know him was to reverence him. The few days of
companionship I had the privilege to spend with him
have had a great influence on me. When I came home
I was a changed man. To-day, I am engaged, heart
and mind, in the work my father so ably laid out for
me. I am a business man; and, strange as it may
sound, I am proud of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène had listened with the deepest attention and
interest showing in her mobile features. When Morton
paused, she said simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think it strange, Mr. Morton. Since I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
lived in America I have come to look up to the business
man&mdash;the man of action. I think his is the noblest of
occupations. The European attitude to the man of
business is both foolish and wrong. Were I a man, I
would want to be in business.&#8221; Her eyes sparkled and
her cheeks glowed.</p>

<p>Morton had risen and was standing before her with
folded arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Helène,&#8221; he said in a low voice, &#8220;will you let
me tell you what else happened to me during the few
weeks between my meeting with your father and my
leaving for home?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were simple enough; but the man&#8217;s face
wore so strange an expression that Helène was filled
with trepidation. She could barely stammer her assent
and stared helplessly into space.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Helène,&#8221; Morton was pale now and his voice
had gained an impassioned vigor. She felt she dared
not look at him. &#8220;Miss Helène, when I met your
father&mdash;I also met his daughter&mdash;by means of a portrait
which has since never left its place near my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s lips formed as if to whisper, but no sound
passed through them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A voice in me spoke to me, and said &#8216;this is the
woman of your dreams,&#8217; and I exultantly obeyed the
call. When I met you in Padina my dream woman
was surpassingly realized. And during the days that
came after, when I saw you, hour after hour, so brave,
so loyal, so good, my heart went out to you. All my
manhood cried out to protect you, and all my soul desired
to worship you. On that memorable morning
in the Transylvanian cottage, when I stood near you
and held your hand, I almost forgot your distress and
came near opening my heart to you. And in Vienna
when at parting you spoke those words of friendship
and approval, it was all I could do to hold myself back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
I left determined to come back to Weimar and speak
to you; but you had flown. Oh, how I have searched
for you! But I had to be content with your letter and
its promise for the autumn. I have lived on that promise&mdash;and
no man ever longed for autumn as I did!
Helène, I am not a youth to be caught by a beautiful
face. I am a ripened man tried by the fire of life.
When I met you, face to face yesterday, I knew it was
the answer to my prayers. I know now what love is&mdash;true,
ennobling love. Helène, I love you. Will you not
look at me? Speak to me, Helène!&#8221;</p>

<p>Deeply agitated, she raised her eyes, which shone
with the bliss of a revelation, to the impassioned man
towering over her. Her lashes were wet with tears
they had tried to hide. Then a mischievous little smile
parted the lips as she whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am still a minor&mdash;what does my dear guardian
command?&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton gave a quick step forward and gathered her
into his arms. Her face was hidden in his breast; she
was safe in the harbor at last! He held her for some
moments when a timid voice muffled in the folds of
his coat came up to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton&mdash;did you say those words because you
pity me&mdash;because of your promise to my father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity you, my darling! Why, sweetheart, you are
the greatest, noblest gift God can bestow on any man.
All my life I shall bless Him and thank Him for the
great boon he has vouchsafed me. The promise I gave
your father was given long after the sacred promise I
had given myself&mdash;to protect you always&mdash;as my dear
wife.&#8221; Then in a softer voice: &#8220;But, sweetheart&mdash;you
must call me John.&#8221;</p>

<p>No reply, only sounds suspiciously like a child&#8217;s sobs,
came from the hidden face. Helène was weeping her
tears of unspeakable happiness. Morton gently lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
her head back and saw her face transfigured with love.
With reverent finality he kissed her moist lips as she
murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear knight, without fear and without
blemish.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shady porch is transmuted into an altar.
Framed between the pillars and above the balustrades,
templelike, the blue vault of true heaven looks down.
In an air vibrating with a whispered symphony a little
butterfly alights on the seat&mdash;a harbinger of security.
And over the pair passes that happiness which the
human heart knows but once in a lifetime.</p>

<p>Through the shade of the lofty pillared portico Helène
and John entered the spacious reception hall of
&#8220;Rhinecliff.&#8221; Helène was still under the influence of
the emotion aroused in her by the solemnity of the
last hour. She barely noticed the transition from the
park to the broad driveway, lined by ancient elms, leading
to the commanding terrace. Indeed, she could not
have told how she reached the room to which Morton&#8217;s
guiding arm had led her. The dread which had
possessed her in the early morning had now returned
with increased insistence; so that when they stood before
a handsome gray-haired lady, she heard Morton&#8217;s
voice as through a veil: &#8220;Mother, I have great pleasure
in bringing to you Comtesse Rondell.&#8221; She could just
see the winning smile upon the fresh face and hear the
cordial words: &#8220;I am happy to welcome you, Comtesse.&#8221;
As in a dream she took the hand which was
held out to her, and mumbled a polite sentence, imagining,
in her trepidation, an investigating pause on
the part of the elderly lady. Try as she would she
could not master her embarrassment; but her gentle
breeding and natural charms came to her aid, and
she expressed eloquently what the disobedient lips
failed to say. She looked the pure girl she was. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
glance of Mrs. Morton&#8217;s approving eye was sufficient
to take it all in.</p>

<p>&#8220;We entered through the South Gate, mother, and
Comtesse Rondell must be tired. She has agreed to
stay for luncheon; I trust you will persuade her to
remain until after dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit me to ring for the maid, Comtesse. You
will require a rest after your journey and the warm
walk,&#8221; suggested the hostess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Ruth!&#8221; His sister had entered from an
inner door. &#8220;Ruth, I want you to meet Comtesse Rondell,
a dear friend of mine&mdash;my sister Ruth, Comtesse.
I have often spoken of you, Ruth, to the Comtesse. I
hope you will be friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Full of animation, Ruth came forward. A glance
at Helène&#8217;s face caused her to halt momentarily and to
send an indignant look at her brother, both of which
actions escaped all but Helène. Then her willing hand
grasped Helène&#8217;s shy offering in a hearty clasp: &#8220;If
the Comtesse is minded like I am, it won&#8217;t take us long
to be the best of friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helène reddened deeply, but this time the little dimples
came into play. The smiling eye veiled the recognition
which the parted lips were longing to betray:
&#8220;Miss Morton, I shall be very happy if we are friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the maid appeared, Ruth and the visitor were
occupying seats next to each other in a retired nook
engrossed in a low-voiced conversation. &#8220;Comtesse,&#8221;
said Mrs. Morton, interrupting them, &#8220;Nettie will show
you to your room. Luncheon will be served in a few
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Helène retired, John turned to his mother:
&#8220;I hope, mother, you will like Comtesse Helène. If
you are disengaged before luncheon, I should like to
see you. Can you spare the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, my dear boy. You will find me in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
lounging room. Was the matter that kept you in town
disagreeable, John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, mother. I will tell you all about it. I
shall put off my Western trip, however, for the
present.&#8221;</p>

<p>On his way to his room John was intercepted in the
hall by his excited sister. &#8220;John,&#8221; she hissed breathlessly.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it of you! How
could you be so mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you, sis. What have I done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you wait until I had brought you two
together? Who introduced you to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>John looked his astonishment. &#8220;Do you refer to
Comtesse Rondell? Why, I met her abroad last year,
through her father. What are you driving at, little
one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John&mdash;this is too wonderful! You big stupid&mdash;don&#8217;t
you see! The Comtesse is my beautiful discovery
of two days ago, the replica of papa&#8217;s Gainsborough!&#8221;</p>

<p>At once John saw everything, even the ambiguous
situation in which his darling might find herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth, I didn&#8217;t dream of this! Please do not refer
to it in any way. I would not have Comtesse Helène
embarrassed for anything in the world. Promise, sis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Jack, cross my heart! But, brother of mine,
isn&#8217;t she all I said she was?&#8221;</p>

<p>John laid his arm affectionately about his sister&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8220;She is all that, my dear, and more. Now,
run off and be discreet. And&mdash;Ruth&mdash;it is my dearest
wish that you and Helène&mdash;the Comtesse, you know&mdash;should
be dear friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Does the wind blow from that quarter, Jack?
I am so glad!&#8221; A lightning-like hug, an ethereal kiss&mdash;and
she was off!</p>

<p>In the lounging room, later, John sat facing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
mother. The breeze entering through the open Venetian
windows relieved the noon heat, but failed to
lighten the task he had before him. Many a time had
he gone over this interview in his mind, always looking
forward to it with exultation. And now, when
the moment had arrived, he felt greatly ill-at-ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, dear&mdash;you may remember my telling you
that I had met a lady whom I hoped to win&mdash;that
she had been lost to me. Well, I have found her
again. She is the Comtesse Rondell. I met her in
New York yesterday, quite by chance&mdash;and I have
won her. Mother, I am very happy. I want you to
love her for my sake, though I know you will gladly
embrace her for her own virtues.&#8221;</p>

<p>John had spoken very earnestly. Mrs. Morton
looked at her &#8220;boy&#8221; in sheer astonishment. &#8220;John,
my dearest boy&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what to say&mdash;it has
come so unexpectedly! Of course, John, I will do my
best&mdash;she certainly looks sweet. But, John....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, you will love her and be proud of her
when you see me the blessedest man in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Morton&#8217;s eyes filled with tears. &#8220;Your happiness,
John, dear, is all I ask for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, mother. And now will you do me a
kindness? I have no ring to give Helène. Can you
give me one of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait until after luncheon, John. Do you love her
very much?&#8221; She rose, floundering again on the
verge of tears. The news had almost overwhelmed the
good lady; or was it jealous resentment or simply the
fear of the change that it would mean for her?</p>

<p>Morton rose quickly and, laying his hands affectionately
upon his mother&#8217;s shoulders said, with deep feeling:
&#8220;Mother, I do. It is not a momentary fancy or
infatuation. When you know Helène, you will understand
that it was not her beauty only but her golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
heart that drew me to her. Mother, I feel blessed beyond
all men that this heart has been placed in my
keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John&mdash;I do hope it&#8217;s as you say. You must
forgive me&mdash;I am a little unnerved. If Comtesse Rondell
should come down before I return&mdash;will you excuse
me to her, John? I shall be back shortly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Luncheon proved a very simple affair and the conversation
which at the beginning had rested upon
Ruth&#8217;s shoulders soon became general and animated.
Helène, who sat at Mrs. Morton&#8217;s left, had lost her
shyness and entered into the spirit of the occasion with
the tactful modesty and grace of manners which never
yet had failed to charm. Mrs. Morton&#8217;s formal politeness
gradually melted into admiration. She was evidently
charmed with the girl. John observed with
lightened heart the approving eye and the pleased expression
on his mother&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>On rising from the table Mrs. Morton pleaded some
duty and left the young people to themselves on the
porch. At once Ruth rose and took her new friend
by the arm. &#8220;Let&#8217;s leave John to his cigar, Helène (it
had been Helène after the first, of course), I want to
show you my patch of woods if you don&#8217;t mind the
hot sun. Mother and John always talk shop at this
hour&mdash;even on a Sunday, I believe. Come, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>John caught Helène&#8217;s eye and saw the look of relief
and longing for a respite to be enjoyed with her
girl friend, and prudently resigned himself.</p>

<p>It was not long before his mother came to him,
smiling happily, her cheeks faintly flushed. &#8220;The ring
your father gave me upon our engagement, John,&#8221;
she whispered with a catch in her voice, handing him
a brilliant stone. And John knew all was well&mdash;Helène
had won!</p>

<p>Ruth&#8217;s chatter became audible from the stairway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
the clatter of youthful feet resounded from the hall,
and the two girls entered hand in hand. Ruth looked
first at John, then at her mother, and lastly at Helène,
who had remained somewhat in the rear. Drawing
the hand she held towards her, she encircled her
friend&#8217;s waist with the other, and curtesying in mock
reverence, and with a well-assumed dignity, said: &#8220;I
have the honor to present to you both the Comtesse
Helène Rondell&mdash;my darling sister.&#8221; Then, running
up to her brother she threw her arms around him and
gave him a resounding kiss. &#8220;My congratulations,
brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, after this, all ceremony had to be foregone.
But it was Mrs. Morton&#8217;s affectionate embrace
of Helène which sealed the welcome. It brought a
great happiness to Ruth and John and a transcendent
light into Helène&#8217;s girlish face.</p>

<p>At dinner John announced that Helène would return
to New York that night and that he would escort
her home. It was, indeed, a happy meal for these four&mdash;now
reunited in love.</p>

<p>Later they were sitting on the porch enjoying the
lovely evening over their coffee. Faint stars were
beginning to twinkle and the air had the warmth which
comes with the dying summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; broke in Ruth, &#8220;it&#8217;s a glorious evening; you
should show Helène the hill-view from the east loggia.
I will let you know when the carriage drives up.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John stood with his beloved in the dusk of the protected
wing. Below them the evening haze of autumn
enveloped the valley and slopes, leaving a clear outline
of wooded hillside against the bright glow whence the
rising moon was promised. From the distance blinked
occasional gleams of light marking dwellings here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
there. Out of the darkened lawn came the song of
crickets and the whisper of the invisible night life. It
was the very time and place for our fairy. Surely he
was behind that dusky bed of cannas, crouching under
the giant leaf of that caladium!</p>

<p>Helène sat supported by John&#8217;s strong arm, and
over both surged a flood of golden memories. She
was the first to break the stillness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morton&mdash;John&mdash;you are so very rich and
powerful. I did not dream of it. And I&mdash;I have
nothing&mdash;not even a <i>dot</i>! Is it right that I permit myself
to love you? Will you not regret it, some day?&#8221;</p>

<p>John tightened the arm round her shoulder, and
gave a love chuckle. &#8220;Darling, the girls of our country
never have <i>dots</i>, even if their parents have sinful
wealth. And you&mdash;the good God has given you wealth
beyond compare. He has given you a heart finer than
gold, beauty rarer than a vision. And ... I love
you, Helène, I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew herself closer to his breast and gave a
faint sigh of ineffable content. &#8220;If papa could know,
John,&#8221; she said softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he does know, sweetheart, and is smiling
down on us. See, Helène, there is my faithful ally,
the &#8216;Great Bear.&#8217; He kept his promise and spoke for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the &#8216;Big Dipper,&#8217; John,&#8221; said Helène
with a smile. &#8220;He has been my good friend also.
Other girls may have a star of destiny; but I&mdash;I have
seven!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fairy behind the cannas rubbed his palms together
in great glee&mdash;and grinned.</p>

<p>With faces upturned they stood as if listening for
the message of promise from the twinkling stars, their
souls in union&mdash;the brave hearts tried, the abiding
love tested. It was the last day of summer; but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
these two happy ones, it was the dawn of eternal
spring!</p>

<p>A door slammed and energetic heels tatooed a warning.
Ruth&#8217;s form stood outlined against the dimly
lighted glass door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children,&#8221; she called out in her fresh, cheery voice,
&#8220;the moon will be up in five minutes&mdash;and your carriage
is coming up the drive!&#8221;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
